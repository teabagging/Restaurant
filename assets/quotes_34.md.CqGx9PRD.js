Not a big deal until the manager at the time proceeded to ask if I was sure I had not ordered the pork. I was appalled. The only meat I eat is fish and that is on a rare occasion. That being said, the person who took the order informed her that he knew what my order was and that he would correct it. It ended up being an HOUR before I got my food and to add injury to insult, she was rude about the incident and did not even offer me any consolation over their mistake. The waiter apologized profusely but you could tell there was tension between the staff and this manager because they kept asking her for things and she kept waving them off. I'm hesitant to say this because I was a server for four years and I know how difficult it is to work in an establishment when your management is difficult. \\n\\nThat being said, I can honestly and wholeheartedly say that since the shift of management in the past month or two things went from terrible to amazing.

Learning that they have a weekend Taiwanese dimsum (\\"tapas\\") service, we went on Sun @1pm. 1st bad sign: empty parking lot. Things got off kinda awkward as the servers outnumbered the customers. We wanted to give them a chance - ordered: Taiwanese fried dough, soy flower, soup dumplings, turnip cake, and stir fried vermicelli noodle. Soy flower was good - delight texture and not too sweet - a little too gingery for me, but DH liked it. Turnip cake was deep fried (rather than pan fried a la Cantonese style) and contents were almost runny, but flavor was good. We're not Taiwanese, so don't know if these are supposed to be made like this. Soup dumplings were good, although the sauce was a little too vinegary for my taste. The stir fried vermicelli noodles were good - nothing to rave about. Then finally they brought out the fried dough, which is customarily served WITH the soy flower soup. The dough was done visually to perfection, and the taste was quite good - until I smelled it! The odor of ammonia was so strong I almost gagged! We've never smelled food that had such a strong ammonia odor. We called the waitress over and she smelled it and she called the manager over. He refused to smell it (why?) and checked with the kitchen. He came back to say that this is how the crullers are made - with baking soda. No one has complained about this before. Well, I told him that this strange smell is not OK and please take it away. He did so and didn't charge us for it. Sadly, this episode spoiled our impression of this new restaurant. I did some research on the ammonia smell and sure enough, there's such a things as \\"ammonia powder\\" that's used in Asia and Europe to effect a delicate crunchy texture. The problem arises when too much of the powder is used, creating the stench of ammonia. All in all, I think the dimsum service is just OK - don't think we'll come back for that, but will give them a chance with dinner some night. I hope they learned the lesson re the ammonia powder!"},{"name":"Apothecary Cafe & Wine Bar","address":"4800 Burnet Rd, Ste 450","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love this place.

Because I'm a burrito whore and there are many keys to my burrito-loving heart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Habanero has been denied access to my heart and tastebuds. I visited around 11pm at night. The place was PACKED. The line was long and the wait for my food was literally 15 minutes because there was no chicken prepared. But I waited patiently in the tiny, sardine-packed dining room. When I finally got my burrito (with all the veggies and sauces they could fit in there--complimentary because of my wait) I was ecstatic. In three minutes, I'd be home. In 7 minutes, I'd be full of Mexican goodness. EXCEPT!! My burrito did not have any chicken, which I thought was the major qualifier of my burrito. The air in my heart balloon was slowly being let out with a little whistle. \\n\\nSomehow I managed to gather up my strength and walk back to the burrito closet to ask for a new one. They started right away, no questions asked, and I headed back home. Still, I was not impressed with the taste of the burrito considering it took two trips and cost over $7.\\n\\nHabanero adds a sauteed vegetable medley to all their burritos: carrots, broccoli and maybe onions. These veggies are pretty tasteless though. Same goes for the meat and beans. All in all, the flavor was just not there (and neither was the chicken).

But the next time we went as paying customers, with out of town guests, we had to wait about 45 minutes for our food, and one of the orders was wrong. Since then we've gone to the take out window 5 times and EVERY SINGLE TIME they get something wrong. Do you know how frustrating it is to get home with your food and it's not what you ordered. Once it was queso and no chips, so we had to walk back to get them. Just now, we ordered 2 tacos, queso and guac. I checked the bag to make sure everything was in it and proceeded to walk home. We ordered a La Fresa taco on flour with no salsa and a regular La Fresa on corn. We got 2 tacos on corn, both with the salsa. It doesn't sound like a huge deal, but godammit how hard is it to get that right? This makes six out of six trips that they've messed up. If they didn't have the best queso in Austin I wouldn't ever go back."},{"name":"Point Zero Four Fusion","address":"8500 Alexandra Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"2.5","text":"4 of us came at 11pm, the resterant is open till 2 am, hot pot or BBQ you can do either one.

It's good, decent place, but falls a notch short of excellent.\\n\\nBistro Niko is a French-oriented restaurant. Yesterday was our third or fourth visit there. We had wine, two appetizers and shared an entree. All were good, but each had a little flaw that merited taking away one star.\\n\\nWine by the glass. It was good. We are not experts on good wine, but quite good at detecting the bad one. These days with good wine being so available, it's no surprise that wine of great quality and diversity is served at a place like Bistro Niko. What was surprising though, is very stingy amount of wine poured in grotesquely small glasses. It makes you feel like a giant with oversized hands. We understand that wine is a profit center, but simply because Buckhead crowd is well-off, it does not make ethical to rip patrons off this way. C'mon, Niko. This was just a bit weird.\\n\\nEscargots appetizer. It's above average, possibly even best in town. The only spoiler was pieces of a shell or something alike present in one of mollusks, unpleasantly crunching on my teeth.\\n\\nPork belly appetizer. The good news - it was truly outstanding. The bad news, it was not a pork belly. It was a piece of heavenly pork meat with everything around it being great. But a pork belly is mostly a piece of fat. It's tricky to cook and unusual for the US. It's a challenge for a chef to make it well and make it popular, and Niko's chef cheated. The result is great but not a real pork belly. \\n\\nBeef Bourguignon entree. It was good, but the sauce was a bit overpowering and while some pieced of beef (kobe) were perfect, some were dry. Better consistency is expected from Niko. The pasta that was a part of the dish almost steals the show. It was so unexpectedly good, it was in a league of its own.\\n\\nOverall, I will eat at Niko again and recommend others. At the same time Niko needs to improve in a few areas."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Five stars for folks who take their beer as seriously as I do.

The ordering process was pretty straight forward and moved relatively quickly. The food itself was about average. The vegetables in the Teriyaki Beef Bowls seemed fresh and wonderful and had plenty of sugar snaps peas which I love but at the same time contained very little actual beef. It was a little watery as well and didn't have much flavor. The egg roll while skinnier than a normal egg roll was also longer than normal so that balances out. It was nicely fried so it had a good crunch to the outside. Taste wise is was pretty standard. One bright note was the option for the Safari Amber Ale instead of the normal Bud/Bud Light.

Good, but not outstanding. Chicken wings ($5): not like Pok Pok's but the bleu cheese dressing was fantastic. My fave dish was the lamb meatballs ($5): perfectly spiced with meyer lemon & raita. And finally, last but not least the Voodoo doughnut cheese burger - how can something so, so WRONG be so, so good? Fortunately I felt too guilty to even try a bite bite but my niece was almost swooning. \\n\\n4 plates and 8 drinks plus a hefty tip for our waiter (because he didn't sneer when we told him we were visiting from California) came to about $79.

I snagged some Garlic sauce, only to be disappointed by its flavor. I got 2 of the mild, 2 of the medium and 2 of the hot. All of them were gross and I am a hot sauce fan. The cheese they used was this processed cheese whiz looking stuff. You would have thought they would at least use shredded  cheese instead of this queso cheese.

I had not heard of the place and was not exactly thrilled about a specialty sausage. Boy was I wrong! \\nSausage will never be looked at in the same way with these eyes. We tried three different versions of a \\"banger\\", the Fried Chicken, BBQ Bacon & Shrimp and Jalapeno Bacon Cheddar Burger. \\nThe Fried Chicken banger is wrapped in chicken skin, lightly breaded and deep fried just like chicken. It is served with braised greens, horseradish mustard and honey & Chef's Momma's biscuit. This banger is bangin! The sausage was cooked to perfection, the biscuit is oh so tasty, but I prefer my greens with a bit more seasoning. While they were good, they are not quite what I'm used to. \\nThe BBQ Bacon & Shrimp banger is server with white cheddar grits and house-made BBQ sauce. The grits are extremely creamy and had amazing flavor, when combined with a bite of bacon and shrimp banger the trio exploded to life. \\nThe Jalapeno Bacon Cheddar Burger banger is essentially Banger's take on a burger. It's served with lettuce, tomato, pickles, melted cheese, caramelized onion aioli on a kolache bun with fries. I personally, was not a big fan of this particular banger, but it seemed to be a house favorite. \\nOur server was gracious and extremely knowledgeable with the menu, and we were waited on with great attention. As other servers and even the manager came over to inquire about our needs and offer their service. \\n\\nNow, on to the beer selection. Holy Pecan Porter Batman! The beer selection is top flight Banger's serves lagers, ales, porters, stouts, wine and they even offer gluten-free options. \\n\\nThe live band playing sounded great, the food was great, the service was top-notch, atmosphere was amazing.

The batter had a good consistency and delicious flavor.  The dipping sauce added a nice touch and had a perfect little bit of spice to it.  However, the pickles were sliced much too thin, which caused them to be dried out and lacking pickle flavor once battered and fried.\\n\\nFor entres, we both ordered the burger specials.  The buns were fresh and perfectly toasted.  The actual burgers were a little small for the size of the bun, but the meat tasted fresh.  One was ordered medium rare, and was served almost well done.

It really is as good as people are saying it is. Thin crust and crispy white pizza, with crispy chicken tossed in buffalo sauce, parsley, and a generous squirt/drizzle of ranch on top.\\n- BBQ chicken pizza: Probably my second-favorite pizza, it has the standard BBQ chicken pizza toppings.\\n- Buffalo chicken wrap: It's a wrap with lettuce, ranch, and buffalo chicken. One warning is to eat it quickly, otherwise the chicken gets a little soggy. Also, be prepared for a little bit of a mess, as the ranch and buffalo sauce drips out.\\n\\nI've also had their chicken caesar salad and chicken caesar wrap, which are both good. The tomato sauce-based pizzas aren't quite as good as the buffalo or BBQ pizzas, because they get a little bit soggy, though I do like the ingredients of the vegetable pizza. I'd avoid the pastas, which I think are a little bit over-priced and nothing special.\\n\\nThe only reason why I am not giving Il Mondo 5 stars is because of the people there. The staff can be a little bit rude, and they're not particularly helpful answering questions about the menu. I also do have some concerns about the sanitation here, having frequented this place a lot and watched the kitchen behind the counter.

Because it doesn't taste like Char Kway Teow! I'm not even sure what oil they used, because it runs off the taste buds wrongly. Some other ingredient is missing, and maybe tad too sweet (i.e. it's been Americanised). Also missing is Chinese sausage, cockles, and maybe some prawns depending on your fancy. Char Kway Teow without Chinese Sausage isn't Char Kway Teow. Even the Penang version has it.

Luckily, they have a bring-home pamphlet of the menu that is much easier to look at.\\n\\nTogether we ordered a mango smoothie, chai tea latte, and sausage, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel. Ryan, the owner and only employee working at the time, was super friendly and sociable. Can tell he's a passionate barista and cares about providing quality service and product. \\n\\nOK, finally to the food/drink review! \\n\\nOh my goodness, let me tell you!! The sandwich was so yummy! The toasted bagel (even at 430PM!) was still soft and turned out to be my favorite part of the sandwich (I think for my BF too). The mango smoothie was thick-- how I always hoped my smoothies would be when I would order it at other locations. However, while the texture of the smoothie was a dream come true, I could taste artificial mango (like the taste from those flavoring powders). My bf says he saw Ryan use a powder AND real mangoes as he was making the drink so maybe that's why? IDK. Either way, my BF loved his smoothie and I enjoyed it enough to get over the possibly-powder taste. My chai tea latte was very tasty... for the first several sips. After that, I found it to be too sweet. Perhaps the 16oz was more than my sweet tooth could handle (available in 12oz, 16oz, 20oz). It reminded me a lot of how sweet Starbucks makes their drinks (which ironically enough, Ryan had told us he used to be a manager at Starbucks). All in all, my bf and I thoroughly enjoyed our order. \\n\\nBut wait, that's not all o: ! (I know, this review is long enough already heh) It was a pretty quiet evening so after we were finished with our food/drinks, Ryan allowed us to sample one of the flavored teas. He asked us questions about where we normally go for coffee/tea and what we usually order. We decided to try the passionfruit green tea with mango jelly to compare. He then asked how I wanted the strength of the passionfruit, tea, and/or sweetness adjusted to better fit my tastebuds (woops, his passion was showing). Finally, he served me my drink and it was delicious. Perfect blend of all the flavors and could taste each one in every sip. Also not too sweet- just how I like it. (:\\n\\nHe told us any drink is customizable so you can mix as many flavors as you'd want for your smoothie, slushie, or flavored tea. My cousin Jeanne customized a slushie and got a lychee, rasberry, watermelon slush with pineapple jelly (which she recommends) that is featured on their facebook among other customized drinks from other customers! Really cool but careful not to go overboard like my other cousin who somehow got the oddest idea to try a 4Fruit smoothie... I think he was overwhelmed by the limitless options that he started to name everything he could think of.\\n\\nWill definitely be coming back to fill up my stamp card!

The food was good but to me it was just as good as other neighboring breakfast restaurants, and not worth the over 30 minute wait. The space is small so I'd recommend coming during non-peak meal times.

House cured pastrami topped w/ melted Gruyere, sauerkraut, and housemade thousand island dressing on marble rye. Pricey sandwich but portion was huge so I got two meals out of it, and my leftovers actually tasted better when reheated. Also comes w/ a side and I picked the Mediterranean Pasta Salad which I liked - sundried tomatoes, olives, carrots, peppers, feta, red wine vinaigrette. \\n\\nCOBB SALAD - $10\\nMy friend liked her salad esp. the bleu cheese dressing - I didn't think it looked like anything special. \\n\\nGRILLED CHEESE - $4\\nAlthough there are no kid options listed on the menu, they do offer Grilled Cheese and Quesadillas. \\n\\nCOOKIES & MILK PIE\\nOne of the best desserts I've ever had.

I had visited this place over a year ago and, although generally satisfied, I could not help but notice that the ambiance left something to be desired; that something was a certain warmth, a certain 'I-dont-know-what' that kept me away. \\n\\nAnd then suddenly last winter, it happened; the place either changed management or I don't know what else happened, but it was remodeled, re-arranged, re-invented! New furniture arranged differently, lower lighting perhaps and suddenly this previously cold and uninviting establishment became a warm womb where I now find refuge during those cold, dark winter evenings. \\n\\nWith a diverse menu and a good cup of Joe, you are certain to enjoy a good time, especially because the crowd here is always nice, youthful, respectful, quiet. This cannot be overemphasized, since at other Malden coffee places which will be covered in due time, there always seems to be at least one obnoxious patron who behaves like they own the place. The staff, too, is great, young, kind (with the rarest of exceptions). \\n\\nThe music, too, is generally good, pleasant, unobtrusive, although it might fluctuate in quality relative to the staff, since I have at least once been subjected to the hardest of heavy metal - and let me tell you, those lyrics were pretty brutal, especially since it was December and I was longing for those overplayed holiday tunes we have come to expect to put us in the relevant spirit. \\n\\nI saved the best for last, since Cha Shu has a sort of 'rewards' program, where you can get a free beverage for every five you buy - just don't forget to ask for the little rewards card! And did I mention the FREE WiFi that is actually strong and dependable? Look for the password on the flyer on the wall next to the  counter. Final note, this place has a great view of the historic Pearl Street Station restaurant across the street and is great for people watching, since it is an area with lots of pedestrian traffic. Oh, one last thing: the temperature tends to fluctuate within this small space - so, if you opt for the plush armchair next to the window next to the door, yes, you get the great view, the privacy...and of course the plush chair but this corner is somewhat colder than the tables towards the inside, near the counter. As an additional note, this is one thing (the evenness of the temperature I mean) that Dunkin Donuts has got right, since as I've noticed, there is usually a double door that prevents the cold from entering, something that would be especially unpleasant during the brutal New England winters. The ol' Double D gets a lot of other things right, too, and I cover these in other reviews."},{"name":"H Harper Station","address":"904 Memorial Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Harry S. Truman said \\"the best way to give advice to your children is to find out what they want and then advise them to do it.\\"  When I went out to dinner with my godson the other day, I asked him where he wanted to eat.  The 10-year old wanted to go to a chain pizza restaurant.  Eschewing the ex-president's advice, I took my godson to H. Harper Station.\\n\\nBeing a Sunday at 5:30pm, it wasn't crowded and we didn't need a reservation.  I suppose you can park nearby, but we valeted and entered.  Initially I was surprised we weren't the only customers there (I expected it to be empty, or full of the elderly considering the time), but there were 3 occupied tables with couples in their 30s.  The hostess was friendly and seemed happy to see us - another pleasant surprise as the archetype is either Irritated or Simply Above This Job.  (Which I sort of understand, as I was a busboy for 4 years, but still...)\\n\\nWhile my godson talked incessantly about the eclectic but appropriate d√©cor and his latest Lego acquisition, I perused the drinks menu.  I wasn't in a 'drinking mood' but this is a restaurant which has 1 page for the food and 9 pages for the drinks, so it seemed a shame not to experiment.  I ordered a Jackalope Cocktail, a brandy based drink which fit my mood precisely - tasty and boozy enough for one drink, with no lingering desire for another.\\n\\nA budding foodie, my godson ordered the grilled hanger steak (at $25, the most expensive item on the menu).  I wasn't hungry, so decided to order the pate (which might be a special, as it isn't on the general menus nicely provided on the website) and figured I would pick it at but otherwise converse with my godson.\\n\\nOur waitress had the enviable skill to always be close by whenever we wanted her.  Not imposing, but omnipresent like a kind Muse.  She offered suggestions, and engaged my godson in a conversation about the method of cooking / marbling of the steak he had been served, and the ingredients of the chunky raita which my godson asked about because he could not find the definition of 'raita' on his iPhone app (Kids today!). \\n\\nAs I surveyed my pate, I was taken aback when I realized it lacked the toast points I long regarded as pate's partner in (caloric) crime.  Sheepishly, I didn't want to upstage my godson who dominated the conversation with our waitress, so didn't ask for any toast points.  By my 3rd bite, I didn't miss them.  The pate stood on it's own legs, and the thought of diluting the richness of the mixture (I'm not a foodie, so can't go into * what * the mixture was) with toast seemed heretical.  By the end I craved more, but my godson was ready for desert at another restaurant.  We paid and left, both satiated by great food, kind and helpful service, and an evening of pleasant surprises.\\n\\n\\nNote - Don't know how long it will last, but I used a ScoutMob and it cut the bill in half.  Helpful.

Take note, only paid parking available so make sure to bring a roll of quarters.\\n\\nWe beat the lunch crowd and got seated right away. We were greeted by our server \\"Buzz\\" who kind of reminded me of a pirate (in a cool way). We were taken aback by the menu because there's 100 different kinds of beer and numerous types of sausage (wild pig, rabbit, etc). I like to keep it simple, hence I ordered an Italian Sausage while my husband got Jalape√±o and Cheddar. We also shared a small order of chili cheese fries (BOMB!) and mac n cheese. We asked for a sample of Weihenstephaner vitus and oh it brought back memories of the time we spent a semester in Germany. \\n\\nCustomer service is great. Our sever was very attentive and easy to talk to. Other than the chili cheese fries, our order probably took 20 minutes but I do understand because this is not fast food. Also, as much as I loved the sausage, I am not a fan of the relish, especially the mustard on top. I had to put it to the side because it wasn't only hot but it had a very strong mustard taste. With that said, I recommend asking to have it on the side unless you absolutely love mustard.  Other than that, we had a great experience. Banger's is super chill and I just love the vibe of this place.

Nice if you feel like chatting w/ others- we did not, so we requested something else. Ended up inthe back with no street view. Be sure to request street seating in advance, if you don't mind waiting. Our server was sweet and attentive. Menu is adventurous, but we prefer the classics. Ordered quickly, coffee refills were timely. Ambience is fun - hip downtown dineresque decor. Sounds of Beatles Muzak with some classic Loretta Lynn and R&B accompanied the smooth diner din. The aroma of bacon and coffee was reassuring. Food arrived, not super fast- but didn't seem to take forever- maybe 15 mins. We both ordered two eggs any style- mine OE, his scrambled. For $7.75, this comes with potatoes and toast. For $2 more, Lee got two strips bacon, me- two saus links. That's a little too pricey for what you get. At first site, potatoes looked overdone- WRONG! they were perfect! Eggs were standard fare, although Lee was convinced he got three within scramb, which was great. Choices of toast - white, wheat or rye- come unbuttered, for you to do yourself, accompanied with a jam packet- no choice, maybe ask for your favorite? Overall a good diner breakfast!

No complaints. Based upon reviews I was expecting bad service but she was a pleasant suprise.\\n\\nRestaurant/cleanliness: 4 stars: very neat, organized, nicely decorated however I had a dirty fork in the rolled silverware. \\n\\nPrices: 2 stars: I don't think the price point is worth the value, my ol man dropped $65 on lunch. That's ridiculous. Mind you we didn't even have drinks! We just drank water. \\n\\nFood: 3 stars: I ordered the conch fritters, the curry goat, and had water to drink $23-$24. The curry goat had 9 small pieces of goat meat in the stew. The food was seasoned well and to my liking but I don't like being hustled with a lot of vegetables and rice to cover up the fact you skimp on the meat. Some reviews say the food here is too salty. I was prepared to send mine back in the event that happened, but my ol man said he thought the food could use some salt. So maybe they scaled back, id rather deal with too little salt than too much. My food didnt need salt but his did. My ol man ordered the ox tails and he was really on the fence about ordering them because he has had ox tails at caribbean joints all over ATL and they have all damn near sucked. Here they were good, didn't have much heat to them, but good. The price point is ridiculous though, $20?!! Hell we ate kangaroo at Canoe for $16 and that's an exotic imported meat! Ox tails are considered offal, $20 for 5-6 ox tails here at chris' considering a pack at publix runs you $9 for 7-9 large pieces which they will cut down to make 14-18 medium pieces for you, a meat market even cheaper! So I thought $20 was a jip for the amount he received. My ol man also ordered the something egg rolls with the caribbean slaw, i think that was $8-$10. the eggrolls were good can't deny that. He felt his rice was like 2 minutes close to being over cooked but i understand cooking rice is tricky, so i gave a pass on that because It doesn't always come out pefect. \\n\\nOverall 3 stars: wasn't the worst but wasn't the best, so our search for great caribbean food continues. The price point imo wasn't worth the value considering we have eaten at damn near every caribbean joint collectively in cobb county, most of Fulton, and whatever that area is by the airport. Kool runnings used to be the best but they fell off horribly to several people including myself got food poisioning from there. I will say Chris' is worth checking out. A heads up though, feeding a family of 4 could easily run you $100-$130 and I don't think it's worth it to bring kids here. If me and my ol man dropped $65 for lunch, dinner with the brood would've been $100 plus. Ijs, we could've eaten at chama gaucha Brazilian steakhouse for lunch and that would've been $70, FOLKS that's all you can eat prime meats and shrimp! So although their food wasnt salty, I LEFT KINDA SALTY. if you want bang for your buck this is not the place to come, but if you have a taste for caribbean it's worth a shot. I would come back and try the jerk chicken, eventually.... like I said back on our search of great caribbean restaurants that can get a 5 star review."},{"name":"The Soda Fountain","address":"2525 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Very good old-timey ice cream shop.\\n\\nThe decor is classic and the entire vibe is really great.

The night couldn't have been more PERFECT.  We were boarded and seated earlier than the posted time(6:30), which allowed my wife to see her roses and champagne glasses waiting for her at our table.  Our waiter(Joe) was phenomenal all night.  The ship was booked to capacity and Joe was still attentive, personable and went above and beyond when one of our souvenir champagne glasses broke.  5 Stars to Joe as well.  The DJ was also great.  He took requests all night, talked to each table personally and kept the mood upbeat all night.  The food was delicious.  Everything we ate was cooked perfectly and tasted just right.  This cruise has something for everyone.  There were many couples celebrating anniversarys(like us), a Bachelor party, multiple Bachelorette parties and even a daddy with his beautiful little daughter(who danced the night away, lol).  All of these different occasions being celebrated at once and EVERYONE seemed to have a great time.  The actual Cruise itself was also great.  We cruised by many beautiful sights and the Boston Skyline is one of a kind.  I highly recommend the Spirt of Boston as it was a night we'll never forget.  Oh and some advice for parking.  The spirit crew will tell you to park in the seaport hotel parking garage to get your parking ticket validated at a discount rate.  The discount rate is $12.

I had my eyes on Mac'n'Cheese, so I wanted to have a meat dish to go with it. First of all, Mac'n'Cheese is not an ordinary one- it was playful, using orzo for pasta, with marscapone cheese, truffle and chunks of lobster tail meat (earlier in the day, they were using crawfish but by dinner they got the delivery. Phew!). I had them serve me Mac'n'Cheese and also the fritter of ham and chicken. The fritter turned out to be a bad dish, bland and no chunks of any meat present and mostly tasted like potato croquettes. I told the server and she asked me if I wanted to get something else. I took up on the offer and asked for a half order of their lobster corn dog. This, turned out to be not too fun either. Good idea, good seasoning, but it needed sauces (and not sticking to what you would put on regular corn dogs-ketchup and mustard) -like maybe some concoction of tarter sauce, tobasco, etc. to go with the lobster meat that is cooked using an immersion technique (fancy!). Adam the manager agreed with me on how bland the fritter tasted and apologized to say that they were experimenting with the taste. Well...I was going to reduce the stars to four, but here's what I ordered for dinner tonight (I can't help myself): Peanut Butter and Jam Monte Cristo sandwich (with Marcona almond butter, huckelberry jam, cornflake crust)! It was accompanied by three warm syrups: maple, xxx (don't remember what) and Marionberry syrup. Needless to say I went for Marionberry syrup, berry of Oregon. Again, creative, tasty and good ingredient makes this dish memorable (and I don't think you can get it anywhere else?) The stuff about lobster corn dogs and fritter can be fixed, and the fact that the montecristo sandwich was a big score, no star deduction for me. You just avoid the dishes I told you to avoid until they fix them. \\n\\nOK- with sugar rush, I can get more work done, and then crash and burn. \\"The Original,\\" thanks for feeding me and making me happy!"},{"name":"The Lansdowne Pub","address":"9 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here with friends and everyone got in except the oldest in our group with a Rhode Island ID.

Went in on a Saturday afternoon and got seated all the way in the back by the servers' workstation.  You'd think that would mean more attentive service, but all it meant was getting knocked a few times and overhearing the servers share their hilarious racist jokes.\\n\\n\\"K-Dub\\" was our server, and was instantly... there's really no other word for it than... awkward.  Every single thing we ordered or asked for/about was met with a quizzical look and an air of frustration like we'd offended him.  Of course, we'd said horrible things like \\"Sure, can I have a Diet Dr. Pepper?\\" so you can imagine that anyone would snap in his shoes.  We were obviously Miranda Priestly monsters.\\n\\nK-Dub disappeared and never spoke to us again until flagged over to ask for something else because of the flat soda, and to bring the check.  We saw him a lot, sure, but his idea of working his table was to simply glance at the table to see if anything was needed and to avoid eye contact.  Even this visual scan was lacking, because not one drink ever got re-filled.  The most we heard his voice was when he quipped behind us to a coworker that the space around their bussing station was tight and they had to slant like they were all Asian.  HAHAHAHAHAHA! Right?\\n\\nThe food was kind of mediocre.  I think it sat for a while before it was picked up because it wasn't at the fresh, hot temperature I'd had before.We certainly didn't stick around for desert at a place where we were afraid to ask for lemon with iced tea because he'd think we'd insulted his mother.\\n\\nI had such a great experience the first time, that I might go back, but not really sure.

I imagine myself being a guest celebrity and talking about how the mussel dish from Canoe is MY best thing I ever ate. I seriously never had mussels like this before. They are not on the dinner menu but based on another friend's recommendation (Tulie L.), you can REQUEST them. Yes, my friends, you can REQUEST them. You seriously don't need to order anything else; but definitely do because everything was almost as delicious. If you come for lunch, you're in luck since it is on their lunch menu. \\n\\nFirst, the mussels themselves are succulent and plump and melt-in-your-mouth scrumptious. They are swimming in an asian-inspired cream based broth (not too creamy at all), flavored with lemongrass, ginger, garlic and other fresh herbs. This broth was so delicious it could have been a soup by itself. You must have their sourdough bread for dipping. \\n\\nNext, I ordered their Caesar salad which was delicious. You can really taste the anchovies. \\n\\nMy husband ordered their signature \\"Slow Roasted Carolina Rabbit with Swiss Chard - Bacon Ravioli, Sweet Potato Hash and Candied Garlic Sauce\\". The bacon ravioli really complimented the rabbit. We were both a bit hesitant to order the rabbit because the waiter told us it tasted like chicken. Which isn't necessary bad, but we seriously eat chicken almost everyday. At any rate, we went with the server's recommendation and my husband was so impressed. The rabbit was so tender and was finished with a slightly sweet glaze. His only complaint was that he could eat the rabbit with maybe three bites. They only serve the hind legs with this dish. So you can imagine, even a large rabbit, would produce fairly small hind legs.  Oh, and yes, rabbit does taste like chicken: very lean and can be boring, but when it's cooked right, it's out of this world.  \\n\\nOnto my dish....absolutely loved the halibut.  It was accompanied with a risotto side.  To be honest I went to Canoe over three weeks ago, and I can't seem to remember much about this dish. One may assume, it's because this dish was not good; but that is not true. It was delicious and I was so impressed, but I can't seem to remember anything past those MUSSELS! \\n\\nSo, run to Canoe and ask for the mussels. You won't regret it. I also forgot to mention that this restaurant is on the river so it is absolutely wonderful during this time of the year. And of course...always need to thank the servers.

The omelet was generously sized (probably a 3-egg omelet) with fresh-tasting spinach and feta and sun-dried tomatoes that were well hydrated and just tangy enough to make the fluffy egg mound interesting.

The garlic bread basket was DEVINE on the first serving. Asked for a second basket. This one wasn't toasted or warmed at all. What happened? My friend had the salmon and pasta dish.

When you walk in, it is immediately clear that this place is frozen in time, which I love, but it's also 2014, and everyone uses their debit card for everything.

The waitress takes two paper cups and puts them on the counter, then opens this big metal fridge on the back counter, reaches to grab one of those big Costco sized plastic jugs of Aunt Jemima maple syrup, opens it and starts pouring it into the cups. At this point I just wanted to leave, because the odds of those containers being clean are slim to none so I can only imagine the other things they do. But I paid what I owed and still decided to give the food a chance. The waitress reached under the counter and pulled out a cardboard tray and right as I was about to place the bags of sandwiches in between the cups I looked down and there was a piece of mouse shit in the tray. \\n\\nI have never been so confused in such a short amount of time.

Thanks to Groupon, a friend and I decided to check this place out and were beyond pleased. Better yet--it's local! And I'm a huge supporter of buying local!\\n\\nThe venue, an intimate one, was packed when we arrived and were greeted with nothing but open arms. We put our names on the list, and decided to settle in with a glass of wine. The selection was beyond the typical YellowTail types, and one of the owners (Niraj) who was also staffing tables, took the time in between closing out tabs to explain a few wines to us and offered us to taste any ones we wanted. We ended up choosing a glass of the Tabali Pinot Noir Reserva from Limari Valley, Chile. Delicious!\\n\\nAfter about 15 minutes we were seated thanks to Niraj who noticed an open table and sat us immediately. Another owner, Michael, was our server and was incredibly polite and suggested a couple of shared plates--Prosciutto & Manchego Crostini with homemade chimichurri ($8) and the Pecan Crusted Baked Brie with Balsamic Honey Marinated Grapes and Crostinis ($7). AMAZING and very filling! We literally exhaled upon the first bite. Highly recommend both!\\n\\nWe decided to order a medium-bodied red wine to share--The Tabali Pinot Noir Reserva from Limari Valley, Chile. Sidebar: We celebrated a belated bday happy hour and with it came a bottle aeriator which we used with our bottle. Very elegant on the nose, and the red and black cherry with spice hints demanded attention...and attention we gave!\\n\\nThe only minor downfall was they were out of 1-2 bottles of red wine that we wanted to taste/buy...which granted it was around 9:30ish or so--closer to closing time. Michael was patient and went above and beyond to make alternate suggestions. In fact, I ended up ordering an additional glass of Tomero Malbec ..and it was the end of the bottle and didn't pour a full glass (although it looked fine to me) and didn't charge. I believe this is a standard practice, but it was a nice surprise that wasn't expected!\\n\\nMichael also took the time to chit chat and tell us about the place, how they got started, and just good overall small talk. Made us feel like we were in a neighborhood wine bar 'where everybody knows your name.' :)\\n\\nWe closed out and left satisfied, and excited to bring back some wine happy friends who have never been. Personally I'm excited to try their Brie, Pear, and Honey Panini with Truffle Oil and Arugula (YUM!). \\n\\nTidbits:\\n--Happy Hour everyday from 4-7pm\\n--Sundays and Mondays have all day happy hour prices with Sundays offering $10 off bottles\\n--Free Wi-Fi\\n--Dog-friendly patio\\n--Tuesdays and Fridays are wine shipment days\\n--Ugarte Cosecha Rioja (08) and Tomero Malbec are the most popular\\n--Toasmorcan Barbera D'asti (09) and Moillard \\"Les Violettes\\" (08) from Cotes Du Rhone, France are steady movers as well\\n\\nIf you are considering stopping by--make it happen.

Apparently I'm not the first person to get concerned if it's actually a veggie sausage- that's how good it is! The veggie BLT has mushroom bacon on top and man did they do a good job making everything taste like meat.

We had come for dim sum before, which is pretty good.  I know there are better places out there, but screwing up a pork bun is pretty hard, so it's a good safe bet if you don't want to wait or drive forever on the east side. \\n\\nOur most recent visit though reminded me why this places sits solidly at 3 stars.  \\n\\nLet's lead with the good.  Some of the food is incredible.  The salt pepper squid hot out of the kitchen is one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth.  It is sprinkles with MSG or virgin hairs or children's tears, or something that just blows my mind (I apologize if it isn't MSG and some restaurants don't want to be associated with that sort of thing. Also I apologize if it IS MSG as some people just can't handle that ancient Chinese secret)  You gotta try it.  They have some juicy flavorful duck.  Though the sauce is a little more transparently mayonnaise, they have some of the best Honey walnut shrimp I've ever had.  Food definitely gets high marks. \\n\\nNow the bad.  Their service is some of the worst I've ever had.  They make no secret that you are there to buy the food and that is all.  You are at best an inconvenience to the staff.  The only function of the staff is to prevent you from going back to the kitchen and getting the food yourself, and that I cannot abide. However it makes it cheaper for me to go, because I don't tip for that.  I can carry a plate.  I'm not expecting OG level service, but I can carry a plate, you gotta do more than that. \\n\\nAlso the bad.  The tap water reminds me of the water that I used to get out of the garden hose on the first hot day of summer.  Not in the refreshing way, but in the \\"Guess when the last time we used the hose was\\" sort of way.  It is disgusting.  I thought I was solve the situation with a \\"Fresh lemonade\\".  Yum, this takes me back to my childhood when I found the reconstituted lemon juice in the back of the fridge and sugar, and likened myself to Louis Pasteur.  Coke perhaps is your safest bet.

Their pork baos are a necessity when you visit here. If you know anything about Asian food, this is your modern siopao!

You'll be close to other tables, but the causal ambience goes hand and hand with their Americanized Asian foods.

I'm a longtime fan of your food from your 9th & Lamar location, I live in the neighborhood and am rooting for you to succeed, so I hope you take this constructive criticism to heart.  \\n\\nWhat's with the changes to be less kid friendly?  I say this as someone who doesn't have kids.  You can't build your business on the grave of Freddie's and NOT be kid friendly.  Embrace it!  This is why you're packed at 5 PM on a weeknight.  I get why you'd want to appeal to a less rambunctious crowd, but you're not going to make it if you keep this up.  You took away the playground, so the kids turned the new outdoor furniture into their playground and did hardcore parkour on the new benches.  Don't worry - they won't for long.  I heard several tables around me complain about the lack of play area and that they won't be back.  Just put up some \\"no running\\" signs, make the shaded area of the patio adults only, and close the playground at 8 PM.  There's too much competition in South Austin for adult friendly places that have cheaper margaritas.  The neighborhood needs a kid friendly spot - please don't make me have to go to Phil's every time my niece and nephew visit.\\n\\nSpeaking of margaritas, if you truly wanted to cater to adults, then why does it take so long to get a drink?  Every. Single. Time.  We started ordering 2 at a time.  It shouldn't take 40 minutes to get your first round and 30 minutes for the second.  \\n\\nYour giant oak tree is sick.

In the spring/ summer on the weekends there are quite a few good deals and also festivals you can attend during the day to try some new things. \\n\\nI recently went here when i wa sback home and wanted to explore the town a little bit befoe meeting some friends at the any bars and restaurants in this area.

There is a new vendor that I have not seen before and they make all these different flavors of macaroons as well as other pastries. A macaroon was $1.50 each and easily one of the best that I have had. This would also be a great place to go if you are wanting some unique foods you cannot find in standard grocery stores. You could as well easily find something as a gift to give people as well for any occasion. Overall, this is  great place to go and if you get the chance make sure to check it out!

It's not for everyone. If you want perky table service and consistency like the Olive Garden, it's not here. But it's also a far cry from a dive bar. There's a good balance here.\\n\\nThe owner is this quirky German fellow who's always trying new things. So if you go back and the menu/hours/drink selection/scenery/whatever has changed, don't be shocked. I've read that there's been a lot of issues with the building and stuff, so sometimes the changes are temporary or simply out of the owner's control.\\n\\nThe food. They recently started doing pizzas instead of grilled items, but hopefully the grill will come back. That's not to say the pizza isn't awesome, because it is. Again, there's a balance. Healthy and unusual toppings like tuna and salmon, yet incredibly affordable and simple. They obviously shoot for sustainable ingredients as well.\\n\\nDrinks. There seems to be a good variety with good prices, but I'm not an expert in this field. The folks at the bar have good attitudes - attentive and friendly without being fake about it.\\n\\nMusic/atmosphere. It's dark. It's fun. They finally did something with the acoustics/sound system that works much better for the size, and there's air conditioning now. If there's ever a perfect DJ set for my music tastes, It'll be on Batcave Thursdays - dark music that's inspired countless musicians, yet still seems 'underground.' I've seen it packed with lights flashing like a rave, and nearly empty on an open mic night. If one night isn't fitting your mood, try coming back on another. There's dancing and karaoke nights that I've never attended.\\n\\nThis is by no means an 'A for effort' review. My favorite places are ones that are human, organic, creative.

There was no \\"I'm sorry for the wait\\" or \\"the kitchen is a little backed up\\" I almost wouldn't have minded so much had we been given a little heads up of some kind. I should also mention that yes there were a couple people there but not enough to create that much of a back up. Maybe 10-15 people total. Everyone sitting and waiting at the tables were talking about how frustrated they were (one woman who sits on town council was especially frustrated). We almost left entirely a couple times, but we had already paid for our food and didn't just want to waste all that money. When we finally got our food, it wasn't even correct. (I had asked for no tomatoes, sandwich came with tomatoes) which normally wouldn't have been a big deal, but after waiting that long I would expect better. Food was typical beach food.

First of all, I'd like to say that for about $50-60, my friend an I bought a lamb shank, chicken tangine, mixed meat platter, Moroccan yogurt, and Moroccan mint tea. We were so happily filled to the brim with amazing food that both of us had to loosen up our belts on the trip back. My first recommendation is that while the lamb shank looks absolutely amazing and is succulent and gamy to boot, you have to get the chicken tangine. The chicken was one of the most amazing and succulent dish I've ever had and the meat literally fell apart with gentle prodding with the fork. I was not a big fan of the mixed meat platter (although this is biased as I only tried the chicken chunks and they were very tough), but my friend liked the beef options. If you're hungry, I think the Moroccan home made yogurt is a must try, as it reminded me of the tart yogurt I used to get in China, but much sweeter. As for the mint tea, I can say that it is very authentic and organic, although the amount of added sugar was too much for me. I think for a party of 2, just get the smaller tea and consider it as more of a dessert beverage to cut across the oily meat goodness.\\n\\nOverall, this establishment did not disappoint and I highly recommend everyone to check it out!\\n\\nFood: 5 stars\\nPrice: 5 stars (an entire lamb shank was less than $15)\\nAmbiance: 4 stars, we ate outside and it was lovely\\nService: 4 stars"},{"name":"Chico & Chang","address":"618 Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I used to order from C&C years ago every once in awhile, not great but it did the trick when you wanted some cheap delivery food as I pretty much only get delivery when I am sick or the weather is brutal. \\nI decided to give them another chance a couple of days ago as it had been so long.\\nWow, probably the worst meal I have ever eaten. \\nOne, the food was delivered cold.

Desserts are not listed on the menu, and if I hadn't already heard from a fellow yelper about the Durian dessert, I probably would have declined to hear the desserts.  Even if you don't have room for dessert, listen to the selection.  \\nI can see where some folks may have had not-so-good service as there were two employees who appeared to not be in a good mood, however they were balanced out by Kelsey, the dude host, and the dude with the fabulous mustache.  All three were enthusiastic about the menu when we had questions and when we asked for their recommendations.

Looking at the menu, the selections are decent and the price is fantastic.  As far as I know, this could be the last time the temperature drops below 60 in Austin, so this is an opportunity I cannot miss (drama queen).\\n\\nRooted in the small strip mall right next the the HEB I used to frequent for my weekly shopping trips, the place was empty except for a couple of tables.  Because I'm a boring person, I ordered the hotpot with the broth I'm most comfortable with, the clear broth.  I'm sure this just means chicken broth or something.  I got it with the beef and down the menu I go circling my eight veggies.  You know that fragrant smell of a hotpot restaurant?  Yea, this place smells wonderful.\\n\\nSo one thing I was expecting was for all the ingredients to come out raw and I would just plop them into the pot of boiling broth as I chose.  Nope!  When the hotpot came out, everything was already cooking in the pot.  Even the noodles, which is a serious faux pas.  You know what went down; soggy noodles by the end of the meal.  I know they probably do it so people aren't spending hours eating hotpot, but c'mon man.  I also ordered the fresh and frozen tofu just to compare.  And honestly, I couldn't tell the difference as I felt I just got two orders of frozen tofu; not a good thing.  But don't let this review get you down in the dumps, the hotpot was pretty good otherwise.  The broth was flavorful and the meat, napa, enoki, and fish balls were all good.\\n\\nOverall, I had a pretty standard hotpot.  However, you do get what you paid for.  The ingredients coming out cooked is a big turnoff and you can tell the ingredients aren't fresh.

While the salsa is still awesome and spicy and AUTHENTIC, the rest of the dinner fell completely flat. I couldn't believe how packed the place was. I mean, there was a line 10 people long outside of the door. I ordered a steak burrito and Mark ordered a chicken quesadilla. When our food arrived pretty quickly we were excited to dig in. I bit into my burrito and was overwhelmed with mediocrity. The steak actually tasted like the cheapest meat I have had in a while. It was NOT fresh at all. There was no flavor at all. It was as if  they fired their Mexican cooks and hired some old Irish lady from D street to slap together a burrito. I ate about a quarter of it and threw in the towel. Come on Salsa's!

Housed next to the old armory building (now Gerding Theater), the dining area is huge and benefits from floor-to-ceiling windows and the ability to slide the largest window/wall apart on nice days, leaving diners free to breathe the outside air and bask in Portland's beautiful summer weather. The foyer is also opened wide to the public on such days, inviting passers-by to stroll in and see what's on the bar menu. The hosts stand behind a large desk at the entrance and will seat your party immediately on slow days or take your name when it's busy (it usually is), in which case you should feel free to have a drink from the bar while you wait. As an added bonus, since it is easy to keep an ear out for your name when the entry doors are wide open, you can wait on the sidewalk outside with your drink and friends on pleasant days and evenings.\\n\\nOnce seated in the dining hall, take care to notice the intricate carvings in the wood pillars and rafters throughout the building which give Deschutes an authentically rustic, yet grand, \\"lodge-like\\" Northwestern vibe. Besides this built-in art, there are also strategically placed televisions to hold your attention should you be interested in the latest sports happenings. Before long the waitperson will arrive to take your drink and food orders. The food is fairly standard American pub fare, but Deschutes manages to make some of the most basic dishes, such as the macaroni and cheese, really shine. And, in a decidedly \\"green\\" effort, beef for the burgers and steaks comes from cattle fed on spent grain from the brewery.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, the brewery is on-site -- steel tanks and copper kettles are visible through large picture windows from the foyer and bar, as are the kegs underneath the bar. The brews from Deschutes are truly remarkable, so sit down at the bar or at one of the several tables located in the bar area to choose from a long list of ever-changing beers. Though there are seven \\"staple\\" beers on the menu that you can always count on, Deschutes has proven to be an extraordinarily experimental brewery, so there is something new on (and gone from) the menu nearly every week.\\n\\nClassic Deschutes brews include their flagship porter, Black Butte, and a very solid lineup of ancillary beers -- Cascade Ale, Mirror Pond Ale, Inversion IPA, Osidian Stout, and Bachelor Bitter -- all of which have their own unique character. Black Butte Porter and Bachelor Bitter also share the distinction of being cask conditioned ales. Deschutes also brews an exceptional organic amber ale called Green Lakes year-round. In keeping with Northwestern American brewing tradition, Deschutes' beers are hop-heavy, but it's less \\"deliberate\\" and more \\"celebratory exploration\\" in nature. Recently, Deschutes has debuted a number of extremely \\"hoppy\\" brews, denoted by names such as \\"The Hopness Monster,\\" and \\"Hopicide\\" (possibly the same beer with rotating names), which will leave you wondering if any malts went into these brews at all!\\n\\nAs described above, new experimental brews appear and disappear from the menu weekly.  When it's gone, it's gone, but don't fret, another interesting and satisfying beer is in the works. As a neighborhood brewery, Deschutes is a sure-shot to do great business in the Pearl."},{"name":"Karam Lebanese & Syrian Cuisine","address":"316 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I figured Marlo Thomas and Jamie Farr are.\\nBut did you know Tiny Tim is one, too?\\nSo are Sammy Hagar and Catherine Keener.\\n...Yes, they're all of Lebanese extraction.

We arrived right at our reservation and utilized the valet (with validation it is just $5).  The hotel is beautiful!  I wish we had come early to walk around see the property while the sun was out.  The restaurant is on the 17th floor so we took the elevator to the top of the hotel.  Once inside the hostess was very friendly she greeted us with a smile and walked us to the table immediately.  The restaurant was open  with visibility from our table straight into the kitchen line where the chefs were hard at work.  Even through the rooms were large and open, once we were seated it was as if we were all by ourselves.  The atmosphere is   swanky without a stuffy or pretentious feeling.   We dressed up but because it was so close to the parks there were people in shirts and shirts ( I'm not sure if there was a dress code)\\n\\nWe made reservations for the opening night and were pleasantly surprised that our entire meal from food temperature to timing was right on point from beginning to end. We tried multiple dishes in the different sections of the menu.  What stuck out to us as notable were: \\nThe charcuterie and cheese plate (two different plates) these two are my favorite menu items at a number of restaurants, but at this restaurant it set a new bar.  They have a special ham that they hired a native Spaniard to slice perfectly and we added it to the meat plate.  The cheeses were perfectly paired with honey, apricots, and other compliments to bring out their flavors.  The octopus - this was tender and light.  It was not tough or chewy and melted in our mouths.\\nThe veal cheeks - OH.MY.GOD.  Order them.  You're welcome.\\nWe each had an entr√©e: the bone in filet and paella.  The bone in filet was cooked to perfection with outstanding flavor that had me thinking about it for days.  The Paella was delicious.  It's not a traditional paella but it didn't need the crunchy rice to hit the spot.  The paella was full of flavor and a wonderfully mixture of seafood and rice without being overwhelming in size.\\nFor desert we had churros and the chocolate tart.  The deserts were so good that even after all that good we are every single bite :).\\n\\nThe staff was extremely friendly I believe our servers name was Alan, he spend the extra time to tell us about the property and the restaurant and to talk to us about the history of the foods and went into great detail about the different dishes which was extremely helpful in narrowing down our choices for the evening.\\n\\nWe caught the fireworks over the contemporary while enjoying a glass of wine on the balcony.  \\n\\nAfter dinner we walked around the hotel grounds a little to see the property.  A lot was closed because it was late, the landscape lighting made the outside look stunning!  The hotel is decorated so you know you're in one of the best and unique hotels around. It's obvious they pay attention to all of the minor details.\\n\\nOver all this was one of the best dining experiences I have had.  It was enjoyable from arrival to departure.

I liked the idea of a farm to table place so close. Unfortunately, they have never failed to disappoint. I have digestive illness and usually have to request special preparations for my food so that I don't become sicker. The staff are consistently slow in asking the kitchen about the special requests that are never honored. The first time I went I was hoping for a drink and a snack. After being mostly ignored for 1.5 hrs, they comped my drink, but I got no snack because the kitchen doesn't do that. I moved from Athens where I was used to farm to table restaurants being very accommodating to my special requests. However, after four attempts at trying to eat here for dinner, I have never had more than half of a deviled egg (which had obviously been in the cooler for a while) and a few pickles. So if you like slow service and food on the menu, with no special requests, have at it. Just don't ask for anything they haven't written down on a menu, like leaving a sauce off the plate.

Our head server was very awkward with an awful attitude, ruining the experience (hence the 2 star overall rating).  I wish our assistant waiter was the only one helping us.  He was from France, and truly outstanding.\\n\\nMy favorite part of the night was the bottle of wine, which I think has a lot of value.  The '06 Chateau Listran from Medoc ($35) was the cheapest cab-based bordeaux on the menu, but had incredible texture, a pleasant nose, and a solid lingering finish on this light-medium body bordeaux.  Truly a complex wine for $35, imo, and the markup isn't bad either, as it retails around $20-25.  The wine service was terrible.  When I was tasting the wine, the server poured the taste, and just immediately left.  I am not kidding, he just left before I approved the wine and we didn't see him for 10 minutes.  He did not pour our wine? I've never seen this, period.  It was okay, because I needed to give the young bordeaux a chance to breath, but this started the chain of poor service.  I had to eventually pour every glass of wine, including the first.\\n\\nWe had the grand platter to start, which is assorted raw meats, chicken liver, and duck liver.  I have not been to Paris, and was in the mood for something new, and this clearly filled that requirement.  I thought it was good, and thanks to the advice from our ASSISTANT waiter on how he eats it with the mini pickles, it got better as we ate.\\n\\nBoth the girl and I had the steak frites (the NY Strip), cooked rare plus.  The waiter sold us on the dish claiming it was the \\"exact same\\" steak they were serving at Chops, but I didn't believe him because of the ($27) price point.   I know Chops serves prime beef, and I've never seen a 16oz prime strip for less than around $35.  About halfway through the steak, I asked him to check again.  It turns out the steak was choice.  After constant up-selling the entire meal, it turns out that you don't even know your product?  I hate up-selling, but moreso, I hate it when a waiter says whatever he can to sell me the dish.  The mark of annoying, bad service.  I am not enough of a snob to dislike choice meat, and the steak was solid but over cooked.  It was probably a little bit over medium rare.  The b√©arnaise helped me through.\\n\\nWe had the creme brulee to finish, and it was a nice, very light style.  Then after trying to sell me on an after dinner drink, our server brought the check.  $124 - Food matched the price (happy), service left more than just a little to be desired.  \\n\\nOh wait, there is more.  As soon as I got done signing the check, our server immediately took the bill away from the table while we were finishing the wine.  We all got somewhere to be, buddy.  Do your job!  We only sat there for a total of 5 minuets, and 1/2 the restaurant was still full.  \\n\\nBOTTOM LINE:  Service was awful even considering this is just a bistro. Food was good.

And how exciting to see a lively bar scene in Winchester!  This is just what this town has been waiting for. \\n\\nThe food was good.  We had the calamari appetizer. It was the right size for three people but would have been too small for four people. Perhaps they size it by party size?  My husband ordered the burger medium but it came well done which was disappointing. My friend and I had the Mediterranean salad which was quite large and good. \\n\\nMy big complaint and the reason for only three stars is the inferior wine list. I ordered the Renwood 2008 Zinfandel and it was sour. I should have sent it back. Before ordering a second glass, I requested a sample of an unknown Malbec. It was also sour.  I then tried a sample of an unheard of Cabernet and that was sour as well.  The only Chardonnay on the menu by the glass was Kendall Jackson - a serviceable brand but not one I would order in a restaurant.  I gave up on the wine and settled on a Harpoon IPA which very good. This restaurant needs to step up the wine list to include wines that are drinkable. I'm not asking for hugely expensive wines, just ones that taste good.  As the saying goes, \\"life is too short to drink bad wine\\", and I would add \\"when you are paying for it in a nice bar\\"!

They served me a mushy cucumber tomato salad that looked like the cucumbers and tomatoes have been sitting around for at least 3 days.

I could only eat about 5 cucumber slices...very disappointed because the Reuben tasted delicious.\\n\\nNext, the Belgian waffle was undercooked in my opinion and was served with overripe, mushy bananas...something I do not like at all.

I was meeting up with someone around 1pm and fortunately it wasn't terribly crowded.  From what I've read, and what I know about the lunch choices in this part of Midtown (which are abysmal) I can see this place being packed between 12 and 1pm.\\n\\nSo, like someone else who reviewed this place, it is a bit on the cafeteria-style as far as ordering.  You enter a queue on your right and are greeted by the owner / executive chef who is very machismo.  Think of the friendly Soup Nazi if you will.  He was very up front about offering a sample of one of the specials (this time a seared tuna, which was great).  However, I'd already decided to try the pork enchiladas ($10).  \\n\\nThe 2 tortillas for the enchiladas were somewhere between small and medium and then covered with a salsa verde sauce, a type of white Mexican cheese, and then hit with a line of sour cream.  It also came with a side of black beans and rice with a fairly small side salad all served on the same plate.  I think you normally get to choose your dressing, but before I could blink, they put an oil and vinegar dressing on the salad.  That was okay, but I rather wanted to try the habanero vinaigrette as I'd read good things.  From there, you can get some chips and salsa if you think you'll have room (which you likely won't) and finally the cashier.  They have bottled sodas, teas, and water, and you can get water cups if you're okay with tap (which I totally am).  Anyways, I opted for a 20 oz. soda ($1.99).  So, came out to about $12.84, a little pricey for lunch, but I was treated, so that was nice.\\n\\nWe opted to sit outside (since it wasn't blazing hot) which you've got to take advantage of whenever you can.  The outdoor seating is shared with the other adjacent restaurants (Subway, Vespucci's), so there were quite a few tables to choose from.  So, to the food.  The enchiladas were flavorful, but pretty greasy.  Specifically, the pork was pretty greasy.  Hence why they probably were so tasty.  There was a good amount of flavor in the salsa verde and as a whole the meal was very filling.  In fact, I commented that I felt stuffed after having eaten there.  The black beans and rice were a little bit better then average.  I really didn't mind pulling out a smaller bay leaf from my black beans because it meant they attempted to give them some good flavor.\\n\\nThe salad was relatively small, but I was glad to actually get some vegetables with my meal.  It was pretty simple in that it had what seemed like arugula, shredded carrots, and maybe another type of lettuce as well.  Again, it was just a taste, so nothing special, but good to get some greens.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa...weren't memorable.   Not particularly good and not bad...so average.  If I cannot remember much about them, then it's a good chance they're just average.\\n\\nAll in all, I was pleased to have tried out Sausalitos, but I didn't find it particularly impressive.  Maybe I just need to come back and try a few different things from the menu.  However, good to know there's at least 1 other palatable restaurant within walking distance from my work."},{"name":"Pizza Schmizza Pub & Grub","address":"18021 NW Evergreen Pkwy","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"3","text":"When we come here we go to the bar section fits us a little better.

To start, my family and I ordered two orders of the spicy tuna sticky rice appetizers. They were amazing. There were 5 small pieces to each order so I definitely recommend ordering more than one. For dinner, my dad went a bit crazy and ordered two of each roll and they were each the freshest rolls I have ever experience. While the rolls are smaller, they have a bunch of ingredients in each bite. Definitely recommend ordering a bunch to try. All of the rolls with tuna were my favorite! I typically don't like tempura rolls and I loved those too. \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered 3 of the chocolate desserts you break open with the hammer. So much fun! The dessert itself was light and refreshing, but smashing it with the hammer was a lot of fun. \\n\\nTo drink, I ordered an extra dirty martini and it was perfect. Balanced and not too salty.

My friend ordered the mixed greens salad, and I had the crab cake po boy with mixed greens for a side.  I thought this would be a manageable amount of food, but the portion sizes are quite generous, even for the sides--I quickly realized that I would have been fine with my brie en croute and the greens.

Their pimento cheese has lots of nice, rich cheeses in it, and it complements the black bean burger very well!

In fact, that may be the only downside to this place -- they have a pretty large selection, and everything sounds great. It creates a real dilemma for the indecisive!\\n\\nMy rule is, when in doubt, Eggs Benedict. If there's a \\"special\\" version, even better. Here, I had a Smoked Steelhead Benedict and it was SUCH a good choice. The eggs were poached perfectly, and the hash browns on the side were crispy but not over-seasoned, so as not to compete with the flavors of the main dish.\\n\\nOf course, my dining companion's Polenta Cakes (+ Buttermilk Fried Chicken) were also amazing. I had so much food of my own but kept sneaking bites of those polenta cakes with candied bacon. Oh, and I'll let you in on a little secret: they have Cholula at the tables, but if you ask for it, they also have Secret Aardvark. Ask for it.\\n\\nThis place rocks at customizing your plate, by the way. Add bacon to this, an egg to that, fried chicken to anything... and the staff is so patient!\\n\\nSome reviewers mentioned a wait for the food. I didn't experience any extraordinary wait, though food didn't come out in an instant (and it shouldn't). Even if the wait for the food was long, we were seated immediately. This is practically unheard of, especially when you consider the legendary waits at Mother's just a few blocks away. After trying brunch at The Original, I'm not sure why people aren't just heading here instead.\\n\\nAll in all, I was impressed with everything I tasted. I highly recommend the Smoked Tomato Bloody Mary (it really is smokey and you should add a strip of crispy bacon), and I'll absolutely have to return soon for one of their legendary milkshakes.\\n\\nWhile the 3.5 rating may be part of the reason that there is no wait for Saturday brunch, The Original simply deserves better."},{"name":"The Spirited Gourmet","address":"448 Common St","city":"Belmont","stars":"4","text":"Sorry to say a rip off.

As others have said, it has potential, and I'll definitely try it again once they've worked out the kinks in the food (not horrible kinks -- it just could be better). I hope to update my review and give it 3 (or more) starts sometime!\\n\\nHere are the specifics:\\n\\nSERVICE.  Service was outstanding. I went with a work colleague for a weekday lunch. The restaurant was about half full. Our water was refilled constantly (even though they leave a chilled bottle on the table), and the wait staff was polite without being intrusive.\\n\\nAMBIANCE.  I really like the feel of this place. It looks like they could fit quite a few more tables inside (between the bar and the kitchen) if they wanted to, but I hope they keep it nice and spacious, like it is now. They did a great job with the renovation.\\n\\nFOOD.  I tried two starters: We split the Foccacia Pizza, and I also got the Gazpacho (a special, not on the regular menu). The Foccacia Pizza was tasty but unremarkable. It was pretty thick -- loaded with 3 types of cheeses -- and I'm not convinced that melted cheddar and melted smoked gouda really go together in the same bite. The Gazpacho was similarly tasty though unremarkable. It's the well-pureed kind of gazpacho -- no chunks of anything. For an entree, I got the Crab Cake Po Boy sandwich. This would've been a REALLY good sandwich if only two things had been different. First and most important, the crabcakes hardly tasted like crab because they had way, way too much filler (bread) in them. This high bread-to-crab ratio also caused them to be too dry. The second problem (minor) with this sandwich was that you couldn't taste the aioli at all. There was way too little of it. I actually had to look inside the sandwich to see if they included it, and I did see it upon visual inspection. I would've asked for more, but we were in a bit of a rush. The sandwich came with a Caesar Salad, which I would not recommend. The dressing was too mayonnaise-ey and had too little spice (anchovy, pepper -- whatever) in it. The croutons were really good though (very light -- not the kind that cut up the insides of your mouth!). I also tried a Lobster Pup (which is a fritter) off my friend's plate, and I had the same feedback as I had for the crabcakes: Where's the lobster? Way too much breading, even for a fritter. If I closed my eyes and you gave me a Crabcake or a Lobster Pup from First Printer, I wouldn't be able to tell you what I was eating, because the shellfish taste is basically absent. They need to use more shellfish & less filler in these items! I'll end with the high point of my culinary experience: the Hen of the Woods Risotto side dish. The risotto was perfectly prepared, and the mushrooms were amazing. It was creamy, cheesy, and wonderfully balanced. This side dish is a must-try.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE:  I'd wait awhile to try First Printer -- wait to see if it improves. If you do go, avoid the fried shellfish-with-breading items such as Lobster Pups and Crabcakes, because you'll hardly taste the shellfish (too much breading). Definitely try the Hen of the Woods Risotto as a side dish, though!"},{"name":"Ka Ren Market","address":"5875 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"Decided to try Ka Ren's Buy 1 get 1 50% weekday Sushi special at lunch and was not disappointed.

Food is OK.  Small place and can very crowded and loud at night.\\n\\nMy wife and I went there last night (a Monday night) at 8pm for a quick burger and beer.\\n\\nThere were women next to the hostess desk when we walked in, but neither one acknowledged us and they quickly both walked away.  One woman kept walking back and forth past us to wipe down tables, but continued not to acknowledge us.  Waiters kept walking past, but still nothing.  \\n\\nAfter about 5 minutes of waiting and trying to get someone's attention, we finally were successful flagging down the woman wiping tables and asked her if the hostess was coming back soon.  She answered that she was the hostess, and told us that there was a 15 minute wait for a table.  She didn't tell us we could sit at the bar (many open seats) and wait there for a table to open up, or tell us we could order dinner at the bar.  At no point did she smile or say anything pleasant to us -- it seemed like she wasn't having a good night.  My wife and I agreed that until this woman learned how to be pleasant and attentive, she was in the wrong job.  \\n\\nWe gave the hostess our name and took two seats at the bar.  There were two bartenders nearby  chatting with each other -- it took 3-4 minutes for one to acknowledge us and come over to ask us what we would like.  While we were deciding, the hostess came by and (without a smile) said abruptly \\"your table is available\\".\\n\\nThe young male waiter was much more pleasant and attentive.  Our hamburgers were good.  But the onion rings were huge, doughy, not crispy and not worth eating.\\n\\nWe were very disappointed by the beer list -- it was one of the most limited and boring beer lists we have seen in many years around the Boston area, especially for a place calling itself a \\"tavern\\".  The beer list included a bunch of macro beers (Bud, etc), only 5-6 draft beers, and about 10 bottled micro beers.  I've gotten used to beer lists which include 10-20 draft micro beers and 20-30 bottled micro beers.

They were either too bitter or too unflavourful. Most lacked salt and all were unappetizing. There was this tea infused soup that was nothing but bitter. The most memorable one was a salmon cheesecake, which at least tasted close to smoked salmon and crackers. Every other salty dish, including the scallop that tasted almost raw, was gross.

I asked why they moved, and apparently they were tired of the old house and figured out most of their regular clientele lived out there.\\n\\nThe new place is bigger and brighter, with a nice outdoor patio. It's definitely an upgrade, but lacks the character of the old house. The clientele seems older as well, we were the youngest people there Friday night, and we're not exactly spring chickens. There was definitely more variety back when they were in town.\\n\\nBut, let's get to the important part... is the food still as good? I'd have to say yes.\\n\\nSince there were three of us, we decided to forgo the tasting menu I usually get in favor of more variety... the loss was that we wouldn't be getting their hand-picked wine pairings. (As an aside, I could have sworn they used to have more than five courses on the tasting menu, or maybe I'm thinking of Wink).\\n\\nTo start, we had a few appetizers:\\n - the foie gras was delicious, but tiny, like 1/4 the size of Jezebel's foie gras. \\n - the seared scallops were exquisite - very fresh, sweet, and perfectly cooked. \\n - the quail was awesome.\\n - the tuna tartare was meh. I'll take seared any day.\\n\\nWe then had a couple of soups and a salad:\\n - Warm mushroom and fennel soup was very tasty... but too rich, the calorie/taste ratio was way to high\\n - Similarly for the cold soup we had, I forget what it was, maybe potato with cilantro?\\n - The spinach salad looked good, but I thought the dressing was too oily and it was unexceptional.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we had the duck breast, seared snapper, and rack of lamb. All were delicious. I was initially unimpressed with the snapper, I thought it was on the edge of overdone and didn't have much taste, but after I ate it with its accompaniments it was delicious. The duck breast was also cooked really well and was very tasty. The rack of lamb was also really good, but I was a little surprised because I wasn't surprised at all by the taste, it was just what you'd expect to get at a steak house. Usually the best part of Zoot is their combination of unusual flavors that somehow combine into something sublime.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the strawberry shortcake and mango panna cotta. Both were good, though the mango flavor in the panna cotta was very faint.\\n\\nAll in all, still a great place to visit, even if it is out in the sticks now.\\n\\nService was very good, though not quite perfect, we were left without a dessert menu for several minutes after our entrees had been cleared."},{"name":"IL Mondo Pizzeria","address":"738 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"As I was stuck working super late again at work and totally sick of Bertuccis and the Galleria I decided to give this place a try.

We were really looking forward to finding \\"the one\\" as our taco spot since we moved to Allston as a replacement for our beloved Taqueria El Amigo in Waltham.\\n\\nSome reviews said this was a \\"hole in the wall\\" joint but it's not at all. It's got graffiti/red decorated walls and all of their chairs and table furniture match. Aside from being small, it's a very well-kept establishment.\\n\\nOn to the food - maybe we were ordering wrong or not getting the right items but Will got the tacos and I got a gordita. I actually wanted tripe soup but when I asked for it the cashier just said \\"no\\" without any explanation as to why. I know some joints only do dishes like that on the weekends but this menu didn't say anything of that kind ... SO tacos and a gordita were ordered - both pork. I had a bad feeling from the start as they were preparing Will's taco combo and you could see them putting on A LOT of toppings. In my opinion less is more with a taco - if the meet is well-seasoned not much more than cilantro and diced onions is needed.\\n\\nWill's taco combo came out first. Tried the rice and beans, average at best, nothing to write home about and his tacos I didn't have any interest in trying because there was a PUDDLE of OIL under the soft taco shells. I don't how they thought a person could eat those with their hands with the soggy shell and overloaded toppings. I was even more disappointed when my gordita came with a massive puddle of oil under it as well. Forgive me if I'm wrong as prior to this I only had Taco Bell gorditas, but I thought these were supposed to be wrap or sandwich-like in nature? I should've been able to eat this with my hands correct? These Google images sure look like I should've been eating these with my hands. There was SO MUCH stuffed between the \\"thick tortilla\\" plus the oil underneath, I was eating it with a fork and knife and not doing it well. Also really did not like the fact that we both had bites of gristle and fat because their pork isn't carnitas-style - just chunks of pork. At one point I gave up on cutting the gordita and just wanted to eat the pork but I stabbed my fork into it and it was like a pork patty - at which point I threw my meal out. Their salsa was probably my favorite part of the meal. It was a hot, peppery salsa done well. Too bad their chips were crunchy ... but only because they were very fried and thus - you guessed it - oily.\\n\\nI guess my search for an Allston Mexican joint will continue.

If you aren't open to take business, you can't make money for your franchise owner.

Nevertheless, I will probably be returning to try something new"},{"name":"Capa Steakhouse & Bar","address":"10100 Dream Tree Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband and I dined here last week for my birthday and we very much enjoyed it.  Capa is Spanish for Cape and the whole restaurant has a bull fighter theme, but I gotta be honest that the red cape that flows near the ceiling reminded me more of a Chinese dragon than a bullfighter's cape, but that's just me.  \\nThe restaurant is located on the 17th floor of the Four Season Hotel.  The restaurant opens at 6, but you can grab a drink in the bar beforehand.  The bar is cool and one of the walls were decorated with Spanish pieces of eight.  I had an almond cocktail which was very good and a gin and tonic which was outstanding.  It may be the best gin and tonic I ever had.  It look like a little garden.  The bartender said it was one of their signature drinks.  One of the best pieces of advice I can give anyone at a restaurant is to listen to the bartender.  Go with what they recommend.  I was glad I did.  \\nWe were seated shortly after 6pm near the window and the views from this restaurant are gorgeous.  If you are seated at the right angle you can see almost the entirety of Disney property.  We were here for an early dinner, but if you are here later I would imagine this is a spectacular location to watch Magic Kingdom fireworks.  \\nOur server, Christian, was attentive and friendly and made some great recommendations.  We also had an assistant server who got us drinks and cleared our plates.  \\nTo start we had the cheese plate and marcona almonds.  The almonds were only $3 which was reasonable for a pretty good size portion.  The cheese plate was very good and included Humboldt fog, manchego and one other.  The manchego was very good with the honey.  The fog went nicely with the crostini and the other paired nicely with anise flavored crackers.  The cheese plate was a good size and could easily be shared by more people.  We ended up taking some of the cheese plate home so that we would have room to enjoy the rest of our meal.  The cheese plate was pricey at $20.  \\nFor our next course we had the foie gras.  My husband loved it.  I thought the foie gras we had at Bouchon in Las Vegas was by far and away superior. \\nFor dinner, our server recommended a couple of wines for my husband and he brought 2 out to let him try.  I also had a glass of sangria and it was very good.  \\nWe ordered the dry aged ribeye for dinner with a side of b√©arnaise.  The steak was so rich and flavorful that the b√©arnaise was completely unnecessary, but still delicious.  In fact I think the sauce detracted from the steak because the steak was so fatty and rich.  The flavor was great and I think it came from it being dry aged.  That being said the steak was too fatty for me.  On the other hand my husband said it was the best steak he ever had (Really?!).  This is saying something because we love and have had some pretty incredible steaks.  They sliced it before they brought it out and on second thought perhaps we shouldn't have had them do that.  He likes the fatty part and I don't so we needed to cut it differently with me getting the center and him getting the edges.  Overall though it had a nice flavor and was well cooked.  \\nFor a side we had fire roasted corn and polenta.  I really expected to like this because I love polenta, but the fire roast on the corn really overwhelmed the flavor and was a bit too smoky for me.  \\nFinally, since it was my birthday they brought us dessert which were churros with chocolate and caramel.  I was so full I didn't even want dessert, but these were really good and the caramel sauce was very nice.  Neither my husband or I cared for the chocolate sauce.  We both found it to be bitter.  \\nIn the end I found the food to be very good overall, but if I came back I would order some different items because I didn't care for the polenta or the foie gras (my husband would like to insert his strong objection. He loved the foie gras!).  The service was top notch, but for the price I thought both the food and the service were better a Bull and Bear at the Waldorf Astoria.  (My husband would like to insert his objection here too.  He agrees the service was better at the Bull and Bear, but claims they are not the same price point.  He says Bull and Bear was much more expensive.)  There were a lot more children here than I expected, so that detracted from the romantic ambiance.  I would come back, but it would not be my first choice for a location to visit again."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I've been here numerous time and always had a great experience.

Since I don't eat pasta very often, this worked out just fine and the portion was beyond huge.  We started with an appetizer of calamari and I could have done without it.  The batter was very peppery and the marinara was salty as heck.  However, I do like their crushed seasoning in oil that you get with your bread.  Now that had me eating more bread than I do in year!    My DH had the buttery noodles and shrimp dish, but he didn't take to the buttery noodles very well - way too much butter, not enough seasoning.  It looked boring too.

So all the reviews that mention the noise level, are 100% accurate. This was definitely the biggest issue. \\n\\nTo start off we got the short rib arancini. There are 3 golf ball sized arancini per order. It comes with some type of aioli sauce. They are so good and I'd say you must get these. We also got 2 pizzas as an appetizer since it was a large group. We got the porchetta and marinara pizzas. The marinara pizza was good but the porchetta was great. I'd definitely recommend it.\\n\\nAll of the pasta dishes come in 1/2 orders which is ideal since all of the entrees don't come with a pasta. So if you order a non-pasta entree then you need to order a side or 1/2 order pasta.  For entrees I tried the chicken parm, grilled Branzino, eggplant parm, chicken cacciatore and monkfish Picatta. I put the entrees in order of how I would rate them. For pasta dishes I tried the Bolognese and bucatini. I loved them both.\\n\\nWe ordered a jug of wine. Yes, a jug! I think it had about 8-10 glasses in the jug. The wine was good.  For dessert we got cannoli and the almond biscotti. Both come with 3 in each order. The biscotti comes with a mascarpone cheese and cherries. The biscotti was great. Trust me and get that.\\n\\nOverall it's a trendy restaurant with 2 bars and tons of tables. Definitely make reservations because the place is packed. The food and service were both very good.

I asked if she was closed.  \\"Oh no sir\\" she said.  \\"Just no one hear up front\\".  She told me that they had a bar in the back.  I followed her.  She led me to a small room with three or four tables and a small bar counter.  There were no customers there but there was a woman behind a small bar.  She was smiling and friendly.  She asked me if I'd like something.  I ordered a beer that I spied in a cooler behind her.  I ordered it by name -- I forget the brand.  She didn't seem to know where to look.  The woman who had brought me back to this area smiled and looked around as well.  I pointed to the cooler and the beer in it.  They smiled and retrieved it.  They asked me if I'd like any food.  I was thinking of ordering some but I decided that if they couldn't find a beer in a cooler, then they might not be trusted to provide a safe meal.  I had my beer, with both of them standing there smiling.  One of the women left the room.  I asked the remaining waitress how much it was for the beer.  She smiled, told me she wasn't sure and left to ask the other woman how much the beer was.  She came back and smiled.  I said to her, \\"How about $4?\\"  She smiled, nodded, took the $5 I handed her, and then looked around for a place to put the $5 or get change..

Today, I'm trying to talk myself into eating my uninspiring leftovers for lunch instead of making a box of fake mac & cheese or heating up a can of soup.  Maybe I'll have a bowl of cereal.  But that's not to say that the food was bad.  And in fact, out of the 7 dishes we tried, I would even enjoy eating one again.  Although I think that the lump crab meat and shrimp served with pumpkin \\"butter toast points\\" may have been saved by the quality of the ingredients.  Everything else was just okay, and certainly not worth the $30 per three course meal we could have had at The Refectory, Alana's or Luce, let alone the 1.5 hour wait for a table.  I just would have been happier, and likely had better food, at Chipotle or Red Robin.  The preparation seemed fine, but the flavors were uninteresting without the necessary acid or sauce to bring things together in the case of my tiny quail stuffed with cornbread and served with a large portion of plain wild rice and root vegetables.  Does the vague but not unpleasant taste of \\"burnt autumn\\" sound particularly appealing?  While the food came out quickly, the service was otherwise slow and somewhat inattentive, our waters arriving several minutes after our appetizer without the requested lemon and my friend's inquiry into if it would be possible to sample some of the pumpkin risotto as a side unanswered.  I do need to point out that the staff were friendly, kind and accommodating, the hostess offering us a free appetizer to make up for the long wait.  Unfortunately, it happened to be a creamy but spinach and artichoke-less dip served with stale tortilla chips.  They do offer reservations for parties of 6 or more but with 4 people, we didn't get seated till about 7:30 with one of our group there at 5:30."},{"name":"The Lansdowne Pub","address":"9 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"So I go to the Landsdowne Pub for the first time last Saturday, admittedly not expecting much for a sports bar in the Fenway area.

Service was attentive, even for 10p on a weekend night (bravo, Landsdowne, that is quite a feat). \\n\\nSo we pay, get some drinks, get lost in the crowd, try to check our coats, fail to check our coats since the coat check is full (WHAT) and end up hiding our coats under a bench in a dark corner and hoping to god that it's still there when we come get it later. Later, there's dancing. First, in Landsdowne (\\"Let's sing along to Journey as this cover band rocks out!\\" \\"Ya!\\") and then in Bill's Bar across the threshold (oontzoontzoontzoontzlet'sleaveoontzoontzoontzoontzWHAAAT?oontzoontz).

There is a huge back story about their relationship to Sound Bites next door. I won't bore you with details that can be found on Chowhound.com.  I waited a week or so before trying to give them some time to work out their bugs.  Most Sound Bites patrons will immediately notice similarities in the fare- potatoes prepared the same way, Moroccan Eggs... BSC is great for breakfast and they have fixed some of the Sound Bites issues from when they were in that space: coffee is served, the Canadian bacon is really good- not the super salty particulate tube that is served next door.  The fruit seemed just as fresh as Yasser's (Sound Bites)- that one thing he's got nailed, but BSC does better. I encountered a lot of older locals dining at BSC on a weekday - police, a priest, an alderman... BSC and Kelly's will probably win over the non-student population, while Sound Bites keeps the bulk of the students.  BSC's Owner was quick to introduce himself and was constantly checking to make sure I had what I needed.  Coffee was great, food was great and prices were good.  I only have two suggestions- the decor was a little sterile. They may want to put a bulletin board by the door to give the place some local flavor and get some Somerville imagery on the walls- I am sure this will occur as time goes on.  I want to feel like it is my hometown breakfast joint.  I will still go to the Broken Yolk and Kelly's feels like a part of me.  I'll eat at BSC a lot, but never after 9:30am on a weekend. Don't forget True Grounds-the only true \\"coffee house\\" in Ball Square- not just a breakfast place.\\n\\nUpdate one day later: I had to get my own cup of coffee today... Maybe it is a weekday / weekend thing? Given that I live within 18 seconds of the 5 most popular breakfast joints in Somerville, why can't I get Heuvos Rancheros???  The kind with green chile, not red!\\n\\nUpdate: Sunday 10/6/07- The Sunday Globe led the City Weekly section with a full page+ story on the 5 breakfast places in Ball Square. They discussed in great detail the friction between Sound Bites and Ball Square Cafe.   BSC won that round hands down, with Kelly's, True Grounds and Broken Yolk somewhat on the sidelines.  I wonder about the timing of my review and the Globe article, but I also wonder if anyone reads my reviews at all.\\n\\nUpdate 4/7/08: The Somerville Snooze ran an article about Mike from Ball Square Cafe sending Yasser a \\"let's bury the hatchet apology\\" letter.  Yasser did not accept and the feud continues.  There was mention that even the Mayor was getting involved."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been using yelp for quite some time to help make dinner decisions and never felt compelled to write a review until now. To get to the point, Joy Cafe was an excellent experience for me and my boyfriend! We visited this place Friday night after finding it on Scoutmob, and were pleasantly greeted with excellent service, delicious food, and the most genuinely friendly owner I've ever met at a restaurant! Let me sum up our experience:\\n\\nFirst off, as someone who strives to eat clean but still loves to eat out, my favorite thing about this place is that everything is homemade (sauces, bread, pastas) & they dont use ANY preservatives!  We visited on a Friday night about an hour before closing time (which is 9pm). The restauarant must be more popular for breakfast because we were seated immediately and had a few seats to choose from in the compact little cafe.\\n\\nOur waitress, Valentina was very friendly and appropriately attentive.\\n\\nWe chose the smoked salmon appetizer, which was hands down the best smoked salmon ive ever had. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered a cup of tomato soup, which taste very fresh, homemade, and was delicious!\\n\\nFor entrees we chose the shrimp and grits and the enchiladas. They were both great! The enchiladas has a fresh, healthy twist to them and come with a delicious homemade sauce and a side of well seasoned rice. The portion was also very wealthy. The shrimp in the shrimp and grits were nice sized, fresh, and you guessed it...delicious! The grits were a tad thick for my liking but also very tasty!\\n\\nOh wait, how could I forget that the waiter brought out hommade foccacia (sp) bread as we waited for out meal, which was very soft, flavorful, and awesome as well!\\n\\nAs we finished our meal, one of the owners, Joy came to our table to ask about our experience. She was very friendly and genuine, and even offered us a great story about her journey to opening up a restaurant. She was so inspiring and very likable! Needless to say, we'll be returning and bringing some friends with us!"},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great veggie dog!!

Talk about crazy!\\n\\nFOOD:\\nMy friends and I ordered the Banger's Benny, Corned Beef Hash, Fried Chicken & Waffle, Banger's Breakfast Sandwich along with a sausage to share.\\nThe Banger's Benny was a lot of food but so delicious, especially the shoestring fries! I'm a sucker for benedicts and really enjoyed the taste and overall presentation. The corned beef hash was also enjoyable. A bit salty for me but lots of flavor (and a bit fatty). There wasn't anything special about the chicken and waffle and I found the chicken to be a bit on the drier side. The breakfast sandwich looked the smallest compared to all the other dishes we ordered but turned out to be quite filling. It was a bit hard to eat, maybe because my mouth doesn't open too wide. I ended up having to take parts of the sandwich out in order to eat it more easily.\\nOverall: 3/5\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nWe probably waited 25-30 minutes in line just to get seated.

If rated objectively, it would be 3.5-4 stars.  That said, it was surprisingly good!\\n \\nI was in Boston for a conference.  After Yelping, I decided to try Pho 2000 for Sunday brunch in order to introduce my BF to the 7 courses of beef.  Unfortunatedly, we partied a little hard Saturday and the BF was profoundly hung over, and we know--and everyone else should learn--that Pho is the best hangover cure ever!  So we ordered one bowl of Pho to share as well as the 7 courses of beef for two.  Needless to say, that was waaaayyyy more food than we could have consumed.  The Pho's broth was impressively fragrant, sweet, and nicely fatty--which might turn off those \\"health-conscious\\" people, but this really is the authentic Vietnamese way of serving it.  (In CA Pho places offer the option of a small bowl of scallions poached in beef fat to be added to the broth for more authenticity) The thinly sliced beef was clearly fresh as it had a healthy pink color.  We both agreed that the broth was very good--though not the best ever, I would venture to say that it rivaled many very good places in So Cal.  So as my BF lovingly dove into his bowl, the 7 courses of beef started coming out.  I think I was most impressed with the authentic variety fresh vegetables and herbs plate, and secondly with the fact that they served it with mam nem (unfiltered fish sauce--overwhelmingly pungent smell, but oh sooooo good when well prepared!) I believe we made it to the 4th course before my BF confessed that he couldn't eat another bite.  Though good and especially surprising that it's available in Boston/Dorchester, the 7 courses of beef didn't particularly knock my socks off....though they did have all the right courses and good quality beef , there was just something missing/off in the flavoring (especially the bo la lot and bo lui), but still definitely very edible.  We took the last 3 courses to go, and they did a very good job packaging everything, including all the veggies, sauce, vermicelli and ricepaper for wrapping.  I have to say that though I normally don't like porridge, it was a good and comforting breakfast the following morning.  \\n\\nSo overall, I was very happy Yelpers helped us find this place and I was definitely satisfied with our experience.  I live in New Haven now and wish there's a place like this close by.  But I'm already telling my brother and mother in CA that I'm willing to make the 2hr drive for it if I get a big craving for real Vietnamese food!

Fresh veggies, fresh dill in the fresh and nicely smooth tzatziki sauce which offset the hot sauce very nicely.

The pho is pretty standard, but there is something lacking in the flavor of the broth. It's like I only taste the MSG, and faint broth flavor. Would it be that much trouble to add another boullion cube? Oh, and also after you eat that \\"giant bowl\\" of pho, which is mostly said broth, you will definitely be hungry 1-2 hours later.

It isn't cheap and if you want to try their extensive wine list, it can get pricey really fast. \\n \\nWhile I won't complain about our service, our server was new (less than 2 weeks) and maybe that's the reason the service was so slow, but it  took us 3 hours to eat dinner, and while we weren't in a rush, it was not expected that the service would be so slow. \\n\\nI admit to having a mini wine lesson, the sommelier came to our table twice, because our server was not familiar with the many wines that they carry and after bringing our table five different tastings, we still were not happy with his suggestions.  I specifically asked for a wine with soft tannins and everything he brought to the table was VERY DRY and VERY tart.  The sommelier came over the first time and made a couple of suggestions.  One person in our party ordered a bottle of riseling, based on his suggestions, she was shocked at the end of the dinner when the tab came and the bottle of wine was $80.  I mention that because she explained to him that she was not interested in a $100 bottle of wine, so I thought it sketchy that after she advised him of her budget, that he brought out one in the $80 price range.  He kept suggesting to me that I try a moscato, and since I don't drink moscato at home, I wasn't hardly going to order it as a place that is famous for their wine list.  The red wine he suggested was also dry, but not as dry as what our server had brought to the table.  I ended up settling for a processo that was not sold by the bottle and ran me a steep $10 a glass. \\n\\nI highly recommend the oysters on the half shell with the Cucumber Champagne Mignonette, they were nice size, fresh and delicious. \\n\\nIt was three months ago when we were there, so I don't recall what everyone had to eat, but everyone was happy with their food, if not the serving size, but this isn't the sorta place where they are known for large serving sizes. \\n\\nI personally made my meal out of an appetizer and a side.  I went with the Georgia Bank scallops and some mashed potatoes.  Found it pricey that 3 scallops were $16 and a side of mashed potatoes were $9, but I'm sure you can get from mines and everyone else post, it adds up fast. I was allowed to substitute the zucchini that came with the scallops for spinach and was pleased with the overall-ness of the appetizer/entree I created.   I won't describe it as mouthwatering, but everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. \\n\\nI recall that one person in our party ordered the New York strip, and it was a beautiful piece of meat.  Tender through and through.  The knife slid through it like it was warmed butter. \\n\\nThe highlight of the meal is the Popcorn Ice Cream Sunday.  We ordered one and split it between 5 people.  Its Canoe's version of Cracker Jack.  \\n\\nWe went outside to take pictures near the lake and one of the employees came out and snapped the pics for us so that we could have a total group shot.

When I requested glasses of ice for me and the other members of our party, the request was acknowledged but forgotten.

HOWEVER, Hawkers is still very appealing for other reasons. \\n\\nFUN, FOOD PARTY WITH AN ASIAN TWIST = Small, shareable plates are the norm here so it's especially great if you have a group and want to try many different cuisines.

Since portions are small, I suggest you venture out of your culinary comfort zone.\\n\\nBEAUTIFUL SURROUNDINGS AND I FEEL LIKE DRINKING = Hawkers is in a restaurant-growing area of Orlando and although the street may not look the best, this place is pretty hip both in and out.

The spicy noodle soup is a tasty sinus-clearer, and we were a little disappointed that we couldn't augment it --even for a surcharge-- with a meat, as it did seem to be crying out for the protein balance.

As a result, this place doesn't get too much loving.  The \\"restaurant next door\\" in this case would be Claypot, which sure doesn't have problems filling up, even on a Tuesday.\\n\\nParking isn't too bad during the week, but be prepared to camp outside or park illegally on the weekends.\\n\\nThe staff were friendly, though it was obvious they were from Hong Kong instead of Shanghai.\\n\\nHaving no idea what to order, I asked the waitress for recommendations.  She asked if I wanted spicy (I said yes), then suggested Sichuan-style beef noodle.  I'm not sure how this is supposed to be served in Szechuan, but this dish was definitely lighter than other Sichuan places I've eaten at.  There were some chili peppers, but the bowl wasn't covered in a layer of chili oil.  Not at all.  In fact, there was no chili oil, period.  This isn't a bad thing, as it lets you taste the rest of the ingredients (such as the beef) noodles, and of course, the MSG in the soup.\\n\\nMy buddy Vincent N. had a fish with (the same type of) noodles.  The fish was decently done (cooked well, somewhat dry, slightly sweet) but we both agreed we've had better elsewhere.\\n\\nOf course a trip to a Shanghainese restaurant is never complete without a sampling of xiao long bao.  This one was a bit of a doozy.  We almost couldn't find it in the menu.  It's not up at the front like 90% of the places.  Instead it's buried as Item #55, which is partially down the 3rd page of the menu.  We both went through the menu literally 5-10 times before we found the item.  And it took us 5 minutes.  We thought we were going blind.  As for the XLB themselves, while they weren't the absolute best I've ever had, these ones had a ridiculous amount of soup inside.  You can literally fill your Chinese soup spoon to the brim with the soup from just 1 of these things.  Both of us got the same results so it wasn't a fluke.\\n\\nOne last thing that really stuck out here - there are VERY few rice dishes in the menu (I think there were 2 in total?) or noodles (without soup).\\n\\nOur final bill came to just $21 after tax.

I asked about everything I ordered including even if there was asafetida in any of the food (usually contains wheat) and was told not to get the sambhar bc of that. I have eaten dosa many times and been ok but nevertheless asked if the dosa was gluten free and was told dosa is made with lentil and rice (as is traditional) and no wheat was in it (this has been my experience). I also had gohbi manchurian and I was assured it was made with chickpea flour. We also ordered the chiled idlis and the fried onion/plaintains and were told after specifically asking that they were gluten free. \\n\\nEverything tasted delicious! Although I have to say the ghobi manchurian and spicy idlis were extremely spicy!!!\\n\\nAs I left the restaurant I asked again about their gluten free practices and the man at the cashier whom I'd ordered from assured me that they kept everything separate and they'd been written up in a paper about it a few years ago.\\n\\nHowever I felt giddy, weird, and tingly after eating, as well as a bit bloated, though I did overeat a bit. This morning I am nauseous and sick, beyond what overeating might cause. I did some googling and according to this celiac site: http://www.alamoceliac.org/acddlmadras.html the dosa DO have wheat flour in them, which I was told they do not. This is from 2009 so I don't know if things have changed since then or what. I also saw another review on here where the manager apparently told the reviewer that they do not use wheat flour at all, however other reviewers mention eating items with wheat in them so I question how this can be fact.\\\\\\n\\nI saved some of the dosa and tried it again the next day (a glutton for punishment I am - plus it was just *so delicious*) and I was fine.

A few places, like Bangers, have gone to the generic numbered tap handles with either a beer listing for each number or something to identify each tap number and the beer it represents.\\nI am so against that.  Part of the beer drinking experience is to see the taps, the creativity and artistry in each unique handle.  Many people, like me, recognize a tap handle immediately and appreciate the visual beer selection representation as part of the beer drinking experience.\\n\\nAlthough we've eaten food here before, my comments below are only for this visit.\\nI ordered the bangers and mash and my partner ordered the curry wurst.\\nThe curry wurst was pretty good. Sliced (steamed/fried) sausage over a bed of fries with a curry seasoning (ketchup/curry) on top.  Not much to complain about here, it was tasty, sausage was nice bite size pieces and very sharable.\\nMy bangers and mash was another story.( All entries come out on a small cookie sheet placed on top of butcher paper.) For bangers and mash, this is a disaster because the potatoes and gravy eventually soak into the paper so when cutting the sausage, you will start cutting into paper and this becomes part of your meal at some point.\\nAlso, I agree with other readers who commented on the bangers, not really English style bangers.  They were difficult to cut in that they were 'soft' and too pliable and the casing tended to want to hang on until the last shred was cut through.  The sausage was falling into pieces with each attempt to slice it.\\nThere are definitely other places with much better bangers and mash in town, notably Dog and Duck.\\n\\nWe would go back but honestly only out of convenience if we are in the area without a car and during an off time since we like to sit at the bar.

I was told the wait would be 30 min to sit outside. It turned out to be 1.5 hours. Fortunately I had beer to entertain. That said, when we finally sat down we were seated next to a couple who were being told by the Manager that they could not simply order from the bar and sit down. The couple remained after the manager left. They could care less and the manager never revisited the situation. Essentially they by-passed the reservation system and nothing was enforced. Towards the end of dinner another couple sat down next to us. I heard the woman say \\"I feel bad just taking these seats.\\" Her boyfriend/husband said, \\"dont worry, I have a friend who works here and he told me that there is no possible way they can enforce the seating so just sit down.\\"\\n\\nI am sure Bangers will work this out. I can imagine it is a challenge given so many are walking around drinking beer and want a place to sit down. At the same time, it is unfair to have some follow the rules with others putting themselves in front of everyone else. My recommendation would be to: 1) Give a light weight wrist band to those with reservations to show they actually waited or 2) have the hostess put something on the table when someone is seated to show they followed the rules. It is going to be a mess otherwise and people are going to get pissed.\\n\\n2) Music volume - music is great but was very, very loud. I heard many people say it was too loud and I could barely talk to the waitress or my wife (we were a good 50 feet away from the stage).\\n\\nBottom line - YES, I DEFINITELY RECOMMMEND BANGERS!

If you've ever been to the Gristmill in New Braunfels, this is the same atmosphere (minus the river) with a tinge more gourmet fusion. I have been here twice. Probably thre coolest thing about this place is if you get there before 7 the appetizer are half priced and they are an amazing quality that if you pace it right will definitely consitute a meal. My favorite so far are the Pork Belly Sliders with Fried Green Tomatoes and a jalapano cold slaw. The pork belly explodes with flavor and always leaves me craving more. THeir Chicken Nachitos (still not sure why they are called nachitos) are also incredibly flavorful and come in a huge portion. If you are looking for great drinks they have those too. My friends recommend the Black Cherry Mojito and I recommend the prickly pear mojito. I was angry that there was a straw because I was certain that the drink needed to be in my mouth right away.

That would be awesome.

There is no reason to ramble about this restaurant because, in a nutshell, the food, service and ambiance are all impeccable and one visit to the restaurant will prove that to even the most discerning diner. \\n\\nIt is unfortunate it has taken me this long to get around to writing about Canoe.  I first dined here in 2004 and had only been back sporadically until recently.  Every meal I have ever eaten here left me with a feeling of complete satisfaction yet I could never seem to work it into a regular rotation.  Recently though, things changed.  A friend of mine wanted to have a birthday dinner for a larger group so I suggested Canoe.  As with all my previous experiences it was perfect.  The fact that we were with a group of 8 allowed all of us to sample practically everything off the new menu (devised by Chef Gould during the 60 day period Canoe was closed due to flooding) and I loved it all.  Since that dinner party, which was approximately 4 months ago, I have become much more of a regular customer.  I have eaten both lunch and dinner there about a dozen times over the last few months and when I finish one meal, I am already looking forward to my next one.  I dined there last night and will be back again on Saturday.  \\n\\nThe ingredient centric menu can be a little daunting but I actually appreciate the heavy descriptions as they really bring life to the dishes you are about to be served.  Last nights dishes for me consisted of the Crab Cake and the Slow Roasted Carolina Rabbit with Swiss Chard - Bacon Ravioli, Sweet Potato Hash and Candied Garlic Sauce followed by their famous popcorn ice cream.  Everything was beautifully presented (without being pretentious) and captured the essence of all the ingredients listed on the menu.  Needless to say the plate was cleaned at the end of the meal.  I am already anticipating Saturday's meal and cannot wait to try something different.  \\n\\nIn the end Canoe is a special place and well worth a visit for a simple business lunch, Sunday brunch, dinner with friends or a special occasion.

I also heard about Gang Nam, not knowing where it was, but thinking what a joke when naming your Korean restaurant this name. Hey, might as well go on a popular saying, maybe we will get some business? Well, maybe you will by name alone, but if you don't have any game in the name of food in Richmond, you will only last so long, so when I was searching for food after being shut out at not getting into an event in Richmond I searched long and hard for something new to eat, and also somewhere to park the car so I can eat in peace. OK, get your visions of PSY out of your head now, there is no 'Gangnam Style' music playing in the background, no colorful music videos playing on tv, no crazy young pop mentality in here, this is a serious restaurant with a not so serious name from what we have been subjected to in society.\\n\\nIf you have been here before, not much has changed from the (Maruchu) Japanese BBQ that used to sit here, to this new establishment, the grills are still the same, searing the meat you plan to put on that shiny metal hot cooking device sitting in front of you. The only huge difference is that it went from Japanese to Korean. We came in and the place had a good crowd of people enjoying themselves to the foods they ordered so it seemed in our minds this place has not went to the crapper like other places who change names. When we sat, we looked at their extensive menu, from set party meals of 2-4-6 people to a la carte (this is not your AYCE type restaurant) this is high quality Korean BBQ. We ordered a spicy tofu hot pot bowl with pork bone, also we ordered some pork belly and pork jowl, it was a piggy feast, that is for sure. As with BBQ, it is do it your way, so if you under or over cook, that is all you, don't blame anyone else for your style of eating habits, that said, the meats were fresh, they weren't your run of the mill cheap ass meats you get at Superstore, this was the good stuff.\\n\\nSo, with all Korean restaurants, you get the small plates that go along with your meal, and this one is no different, from the kimchi to the pickled vegetables and marinated potato, it's all there. Also, what I like to joke on, the prison metal covered bowls with piping hot rice come out to your table to accompany your food. We were well attended to from our server, as she was always asking us how the meal was, and always watching the gas range to see if we needed to turn up the fire, or turn it down. I loved every bite of the meats that we ordered. The other star was the tofu soup, it had a different taste to it, non-msg (no dizzying aftereffects) not overly salty, it was in a better word, very homey in taste with a lot of stuff in the small cooking pot, many pieces of meat and bone, and an egg that was slowly cooking once coming to the table.\\n\\nI was skeptical about this place when I saw the name, but I can say it is one of the better Korean restaurants, especially in Richmond where there are a handful now and I see myself coming back to try more things on the menu. Also, they are still considered new and gave us a 10% grand opening discount, always good to get a bit shaved off the bill, but even without it the meal was affordable. It came out to under $30 for the two of us, we were stuffed and needed some takeout boxes where the food was eventually devoured by others! Next time I hear the word Gang Nam... I will be thinking of this place."},{"name":"Bistro Niko","address":"3344 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Has a wonderful experience with the food and the service.

I moved out here 3 years ago, and before trying Big Vinnys, I'd gone to so many places! Top BBQ places in Austin, you name them, I've been there! Since trying Big Vinnys the first time, I found myself no longer having to go anywhere else! The meat is so good! No doubt the best brisket and babybacks you could ever ask for! I went to Big Vinnys back 5 months ago, and I kid you not, it's the only BBQ I've been going to since! Next, the owner Brian is one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. After my first conversation with the guy, I instantly knew this is someone I feel 100% confident in giving my business to! His background story is amazing, and his kind heart shows when he's dishing out plates! The prices are as fair as you'd want; in fact, better than you ask for when you include the serving size he hooks you up with! The dude put his maximal effort at satisfying his customers! I know this because I've seen him satisfy others, and he also fulfills mine every single time! And finally, Big Vinnys is super convenient and efficient! There is never a long wait, and on top of that, they deliver! Brian has told me of the supreme amount of meat he's prepping and cooking everyday, so he just keeps them rolling, never running out! You also don't have to travel far, with it being close to the center of Austin. Big Vinnys is not just my top BBQ spot, but also my top food spot!

This was topped with a thick gelatinous hollandaise sauce.  The turkey had a gross sweetness about it, which either means it was maple cured or past it's prime.

It shouldn't be like pulling teeth--the staff definitely needs some lessons in customer service. It was a small bar, but they had the basics. Overall food was so-so. Some hits and some misses. I found most to be overly saucy and lacking the main ingredient--be it meat or potatoes or whatever. In fact the potato dish they had, had no potatoes. Just the sauce and they never refilled it the whole time I was there, even so they did stir it frequently so they must have seen it was \\"empty\\". The tandoori chicken was cold and lacked flavor. The chickpea dish was good, the paneer dish was excellent. I finally flagged someone down halfway through the first plate and asked about the bread. The guy finally brought it out--plain naan.

On the journey for any kind of good eats at night someone suggested we check out the old HKYK across the street, and because that place was closing at about 11PM and us men can talk like women when gathered together we walked into this place. At the time we came in, about 10:30 PM it had a few big tables, but nothing close to packed. I think we were out in the cold too long, as this place felt cold, and the a/c felt jacked. Another piece of info you should know is.. if you are some human vampire that needs to hide from light, this place is definitely not for you, as it is beyond bright in here for a late night establishment, like an inside joke of what you bring with you from the clubs this one would give you some insight (or more sight to what you see with who you bring) and also a good view of the food you ordered! This place is open right up to 2AM, another plus for serving the da lang menu, so with the four of us needing dinner the order was put in.\\n\\nOver $20 and you get a free large bowl of plain congee (looked like a medium size) so that's a bonus for plain ass white rice porridge. We were shot down on two orders, the deep fried silver fish, and the deep fried chicken knuckle... two of the most popular dishes for late night eats that is like pearls for bubble tea!!!! No matter, we still ended up ordering the peppery deep fried tofu, meat bits with string beans, shrimp with scrambled eggs, some house pork chop (due to not having the two items we actually wanted) and garlic pea snow pea tip, and for a good HK twist to mix with our congee a plate of the soy sauce fried noodle (this is a Chinese thing that I still don't really understand!). The food came kind of out of order, as usual you need the staple congee to come out first like rice on the side, instead we ended up with the scrambled eggs and tofu to start, and this place started getting busier, with two servers, and who knows how many people working in the kitchen, where there were empty tables... there was no more!\\n\\nEach dish that came out was fresh off the fire, hot, steam flying into the air, but this is a restaurant, big flippin deal... how did it taste you ask.. everyone on the table kept picking at the foods like buzzards on a tree top swooping to kill. Each plate excelled in what you would call food that is late night eats.. and the normal impression you get is that as long as it is good enough... well this was the next step, this was freaking good food that I would order anytime of the day. Stuff like the deep fried tofu, looked a little browner, and the bits were far smaller in size than any place I have ever seen, but each cubic bit was perfect, and non-oily. The scrambled eggs were mixed with huge shrimp, and it was semi-runny (perfect), the snow pea tips... again, not oily... like some restaurants I've had this plate for regular dinner. Service was a little slow on this night, but it didn't deter us to order more, even their signature pork chop had a taste that was fit for fried fish, but worked with the pork, this was quality late night food, and we were eating it! \\n\\nSome meals late at night make you feel disgusting when you wake up the next day, this one did not. I did not suffer any mild headache, the food was clean, and that saying I really don't think they are using any MSG... or very little, which is hard to come by. My friend could recognize one of the tables sitting were the dealers from River Rock, I ended up bumping into another friend who was with his staff from one of the bigger restaurants in Richmond, and other tables were just here having a good time with food and booze (saw wine and beer!). The big tv in the back was streaming HK television direct from the source. I have a feeling they were short on staff this night, but that doesn't deter me from giving this place high marks, as I said to others, this was one of the best 'da lang's' I have had in years!!

This is the second establishment with small plates which isn't entirely bad if you like variety at one sitting. The roti was more like a pancake as I'm used to paper thin. The curry dip was a bit in the spicy side but still very good. The lettuce wrap tasty. Wonton noodle soup used authentic Chinese noodles and the Wonton good but the skin on the thick side plus the Wontons stuck together. The beef har fun was good but the noodles a bit on the al dente side. All the dishes were on the salty side but thankfully not swimming in sauce as that is more for the American palette. Service was slow to start but picked up rapidly. Server was friendly and attentive. What was amazing was how busy it was on a Saturday afternoon at 3pm.

A martini without vermouth is cold gin (which is fine, if that's what you like) and chili that is all hot and no flavor is a drag.

After the closing, we were in search of our new Mexican go-to and we tried a few places. We were not always disappointed by what we found with those other places, but we weren't ever happy enough to visit again, either. \\n\\nAnd so, we were hopeful yet skeptical when we tried Lindo Mexico. \\n\\nYou receive the standard chips and salsa before the meal arrives - I like the salsa here! It's tasty and it tastes like it's been freshly made. I like that it's not too spicy so that you can enjoy the burst of flavors that it delivers. It's bright and flavorful with just a little bit of bite to it. \\n\\nI ordered the Mero Macho Combinacion which features their beef burrito Suizo, a shredded beef tamale, and a chili relleno. I want to mention that for me, there are two 'measures' for me when it comes to Mexican food: one, they MUST serve horchata (because when I'm eating spicy Mexican, I need that drink to soothe my palate) and their chili rellenos need to be spot on. \\n\\nChili rellenos are a simple dish to recreate, they're simply mild chili peppers that are stuffed with cheese and then battered in an egg batter and fried to a golden brown. Simple enough, right? But for some reason, more Mexican restaurants seem to get them wrong than get them right - at least for me.\\n\\nSo the first thing that I cut into when our dinner was served was the chili relleno - and it was perfection. The molten cheese slowly oozed out of the  relleno - it was smooth and cheesy and it was quite simply gooey melted cheese perfection. \\n\\nIf I were judging Lindo Mexico solely on the Chili Rellenos and the fact that they had horchata (with free refills, I might add!) they'd get 5 very enthusiastic stars. \\n\\nBut I also had the burrito and the tamale and I need to factor those into the review - as well as the fact that for our second visit, I tried their steak fajitas. \\n\\nThe steak fajitas are spectacular. Lots of tender beef, thinly sliced, cooked to medium doneness, the onions and bell peppers were caramelized nicely but were not slimy. My biggest complaint about the fajitas is that it came with only 3 warmed tortillas so I had more filling than I did tortilla. So high scores for the fajita.\\n\\nThe tamale was good, but I don't know that it would have earned 5 stars on it's own so I take that into account with my score but what really knocked my score down to the 4 stars rather than 5 is the beef burrito suiza. This was really rather unremarkable and I wasn't able to eat more than a couple of bites of it because it reminded me just a little bit of the kind of burrito you might find in the frozen food section of the grocery store.\\n\\nHowever, since the burrito is the only thing that I didn't enjoy - hubby swears by the chicken chimichangas! - I can't let that deter me from giving this place 4 stars because this is a very friendly and clean establishment with a staff that treats you like friends. The service is top-notch and the food even better - and the meal is brought out to you, piping hot, in record time! \\n\\nOur new Mexican go-to!"},{"name":"Grass Skirt Tiki Room","address":"105 N Grant Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Aloha! We finally visited this gem for a Friday happy hour and boy, we were in for a.... treat? Something like that.\\n\\nFor some reason, I was expecting this place to be Short North trendy Hawaiian, not touristy-hawaiiain. I don't consider my expectations too be too outlandish, considering who owns the join. But alas, this did not fit the mold of a trendy unique space... it was very kitschy, and I was disappointed.\\n\\nNevertheless, it stayed true to a Hawaiian theme. Our food was okay... yeah, just okay. I won't go any farther with that. We had the crab rangoon, nothing special. And we both had some type of sandwich. They were very tasty, but a bummer you had to pay extra for the salsa. The chips would be lifeless without it. \\n\\nWe each had plenty of cocktails.. it was happy hour after all! The special was delicious, and the sangria was tasty, yet small.

Decent pub grub at fairly reasonable prices.\\n\\nDownside?  It's location attracts lots of students, acting like students often do, as if it's pledge week at Chi Phi or Tri-Delt.  This does NOT add to the atmosphere, but I can often ignore this factor in other campus-area establishments.\\n\\nThe big problem for me is the Flying Saucer's attitude toward other beer emporia in town, notably the Ginger Man and the Draft House--the word has apparently come down from the Flying Saucer mothership that these two bars are \\"the enemy\\" and are to be disparaged and discredited at every opportunity.  This, quite plainly, sucks.   When I first visited in the Spring, word had just come out that the Ginger Man was moving.  I heard from no less than three people, including the manager a variation on \\"Oh, they are closed.\\"  or \\"I heard they are going out of business.\\"  or  \\"I guess we were too much for them.\\"  I corrected each one, including the manager pointing out that I like beer, and visit beer bars often, including Ginger Man, and they were definitely NOT closing--just moving.\\n\\nSecond visit, in mid Summer, during an amazing rainstorm, I ducked in for a bite and a pint to escape the storm.  When I mentioned the tap selection was as impressive as the one at Draft House, she said \\"yeah, and our beer is fresh and clean too.\\"  Same visit, at the bar, now looking for a patterned response I asked the bartender if they had more taps than Ginger Man.  \\"Doesn't matter anymore I guess, they are closing...\\" was his reply.\\n\\nLast visit, and I do mean last was a little over a week ago.  Had a decent pint and some brats that were pretty good too.  Again, a casual question about other beer establishments resulted in a disparaging comment about the same 2 bars from 2 different servers.  This is no longer random, nor \\"rogue employees\\" or \\"a few bad apples.\\"  This looks like policy.\\n\\nMy conclusion, the douchenozzles on my side of the bar are NOT the only ones at Flying Saucer.  The others work there, and are apparently instructing their staff that the way to win friends and influence beer drinkers is to blast your competition instead of celebrating it.\\n\\nWe live in a city where fine beers on tap and in bottles are easy to find.  In most cities, these beer havens support and embrace and endorse one another, knowing that fine beer connoisseurs will regularly visit each one to sample their latest fare.  \\n\\nHere, one bar apparently does not \\"play well with others.\\"\\n\\nNo matter--I can drink elsewhere."},{"name":"Fellini's Pizza","address":"4429 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love good pizza .

After my first experience here I can already see this place turning into one of my go-to spots. We ordered the cheese plate, beef carpaccio, watermelon/pork belly/goat cheese bites, and a bottle of riesling. During their happy hour, you get $2 off all starters with the exception of the two cheapest items. The happy hour discount isn't groundbreaking by any means, but if it's a discount I'll take it!\\n\\nMy favorite out of our orders was the cheese plate which I HIGHLY recommend. The combination of the bold flavors from cheese with the muted sweetness of the dried fruit chutney was surprisingly good. Add in crackers and a dab of honey and it was perfection. The plate also comes with olives and grapes which I didn't care to try because I was too busy obsessing over the chutney. Coming in at a close second were the watermelon/pork belly/goat cheese bites. I'm already a big fan of pork belly, so throw in a juicy cube of watermelon, a cheese piece, and basil leaf and it really turns into the perfect bite. You get a variety of textures with that dish as well which is always a plus in my book. The beef carpaccio was good but not outstanding in my opinion, although my two other friends loved the dish. I think it's safe to say I would recommend our entire meal to anyone.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I'm somewhat of a wine noob. (What am I doing at a wine bar, right?) I believe on Sundays/Mondays a bottle of wine is $10 off which I will definitely be back for because I need to step up my wine game.

The beer names are Red Zeppelin, Zombie Dragon, and Northern Light.\\n\\nI ordered a Northern Light beer and Fish n' Chips.  This place is a really pub with a nice bar, outdoor playground for kids, different seating areas, and a private room.  They sell a growler where you can take beer home with you or if available six pack of cans.  As I was waiting for my order a group of young people walked in headed straight into the bar and the bartender asked if they were here for lunch, and they said we are here for beer.  This got me thinking was this a place for great food or beer? The answer is both.\\n\\nMy order arrived and always enjoy fish & chips with beer.  The fish were fried with a crispy batter and big pieces.  It came with fries and tarter sauce which also good enough to dip my fries into.

My bf isn't from Columbus so I was excited to show him this gem. Why the lower rating? Read on. I ordered off the RW menu- house salad, scallops with gnocchi and baked apple crumble with vanilla ice cream. Bf got the house salad, shrimp and grits small plate and duck confit gumbo small plate. Our salads came out and his was about twice the size of mine. Good salad but felt pretty jipped. Isn't the point of RW to let people done at your restaurant when it would otherwise be too expensive? Anyways on the the mains. While my scallops were delicious and cooked just right, there were only 3 and the food was a tad too cool. There were about 5 or 6 pieces of sweet potato gnocchi. The dish needed at least a dozen gnocchi - one for each bite of scallop (got about 4 bites per scallop) and maybe then some. The sauce was amazing but again needed some more of that. For the $30 it just felt short changed. The bf's shrimp in the shrimp and grits were super rubbery! Never in my life have I tasted rubbery shrimp - even frozen from the grocery store. Also only 3 regular sized shrimps in a $10 dish. The duck confit gumbo was amazinnnng. Calling it a gumbo is a bit misleading as the texture and resemblance wasn't that of gumbo. I just had a couple bites of it but I could tell it's a pretty filling dish for $9. We both agreed the dessert was very yummy. Bf said it was the best part of the meal. Towards the end of our meal it started to get super cold in our booth (was never warm or comfortable to begin with though). We were in the back room corner. You could feel the air seeping in from the wall and our feet felt like ice cubes. Definitely need to have some more insulation blown in or turn up the heat!! Service was okay. I appreciated the hostess changing out my napkin from white to black (had on black pants) upon seating us.

That's customer service that you really don't find every day.\\n\\nAt a lot of places, you get the feel that they couldn't really care less if you left full and pleased or empty and disappointed, so long as they got your money.

I knew that Portland was known for their breweries and Deschutes was the first one we saw so we decided to give it a chance. It took about half an hour to get seated which was pretty decent for a Saturday night. We ordered the elk meatballs as an appetizer which the bf liked but I thought was kind of dry. He ordered the lamb burger which he also loved, but he loves anything lamb. His favorite beer there was the Obsidian Stout. I ordered the mac 'n' cheese which was really good as well.

Everything was totally on point, from level of doneness, to spice level, to amount of seasoning, to quality of ingredients. \\n\\nI came here with my friend on a Sunday afternoon and we were seated immediately.  The decor inside had a very clean and modern aesthetic, with comfortable seating.  The staff was very friendly were able to answer any questions we had. \\n\\nBut really, this review is about the food.  OMFG the food. Both me and my friend ordered the corn cakes and we very could've easily shared one order and been fine.  These are unlike any other corn cakes I've had.  \\n\\nThe closest thing I've had are my dad's corn fritters, which are from a Southern recipe.  Those fritters are more of a cake-y, doughy affair.  \\n\\nThe corn cakes at Cha Yen are more like a crispy lattice to hold the corn kernels, giving a very satisfying crunch with each bite, along with a burst of corn flavor when you hit the kernels (which is on most bites). \\n\\nThey also get served with a sweet peanut sauce that compliments the cakes very well, although it wasn't the thick satay type of sauce I was expecting but was instead more of a clear, liquidy sauce.  The cakes were also just a tiny bit greasy, but for less than $6 for a massive portion, that's really nitpicking. \\n\\nAs an entree, I got the tao hu song krueng, which is a tofu and vegetable dish with a bit of ground chicken.  The tofu is deep fried, although it isn't breaded, which is what I thought it would be, but it turned out to be good nonetheless.  \\n\\nThe flavor of the sauce, which was kind of sweet with herbal notes (especially basil), permeated the tofu fairly well, although the center was still a bit bland.  \\n\\nThe vegetables were good, although I think they were frozen, but one can't expect fresh corn and green peas for a $10 entree. \\n\\nThe dish was a good bit better when it was mixed with the rice the day after and the tofu had fully absorbed all the flavors. \\n\\nWhile neither dish was flawless, they came pretty close, all things considered.  I would've tried the ice cream but they didn't have the jasmine Thai basil flavor that I wanted to taste, so that'll have to wait for a future update, cause you damn well better believe I'll be back.

End I didn't like.   It was over a year and a half ago that I visited so some of the details are fuzzy, but I do remember waiting two hours to be seated (I was with my parents, my bf, and his parents, so we had a large group, but we had made a reservation).   During that 2 hours of standing we asked repeatedly for bread (we were starving) and never got any.   The staff was incredibly rude and couldn't explain why we couldn't be seated when we had a reservation.   We would have gone elsewhere but it was like 9 pm on a Friday or Saturday night and we figured we wouldn't have gotten seated much faster anywhere else.    It turns out that's what we should have done, even if we had to wait in line somewhere else, because once we did get seated the service was rude and the food was terrible.    Most, if not all, the dishes we ordered were cold.   At this point it was probably around 11 pm, so I might be able to excuse the restaurant on this, but based on all the other bad things I won't be back anyway.   I ordered something that had veal in it (tre formaggi, I think) and there was LITERALLY one quarter-sized piece of veal.   I complained and they neither offered me a new dish nor a refund.    All in all, a miserable experience - one of the few North End restaurants you should really avoid.\\n\\nUPDATE:  I hear this place is now closed (why I am not surprised...), so I guess this review is moot."},{"name":"Sarpino's - Cedar Park","address":"10401 Anderson Mill Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Honest and caring employees, awesome pizza.

I ordered the Wildboar sausage (smokey and the boar) which was also delicious.   Both of our sausages came on the kolache bun which tasted like heaven.   The side of German potato salad received mixed reviews as I loved it but my wife thinks she can do better. We both agreed the dressing was delicious but her issue was more with the potatoes tasted as if they were caulked the day before.   They have a expansive offering of beers  to cover all texts from my love of German wheat beers to my wife's preference for darker stouts. \\n\\n There are two big negatives to this place based on both of our visits.   Parking anywhere near downtown Austin just sucks so get your mind right.  And there is no good parking in the area. We just lucked out  and was able to squeeze our car on the side street. The other issue I have on both visits as the service. Although the restaurant was not busy, the service was subpar on both visits.   For the first 10 minutes we didn't even know who our server was.

I was truly expecting a treat after reading the reviews. Unfortunately, neither the food or the service was good! It appears that of you're not sitting at the bar or at a booth you will not be served. We were seated behind the hostess, and we were the only people seated at the tables in the middle. Not one person came to greet us or take our order after about ten minutes or longer, I then turned around and asked the hostess if we were going to be served. \\n\\nShe came over and stated she would take our drink order and informed that the waitress working our area was very busy serving others. I only saw one waiter working and checking on his tables. I had no idea who she was referring to because there were two people behind the bar. The female was talking about living in New York, laughing and having fun like she was a guest and the male was working hard making drinks. We informed the hostess, who was very pleasant by the way, that we were ready to order. She then came over to take our order. The conch fritters appetizer taste as if they were left in the grease too long though we were upset we did not complain. \\n\\nThe female who was working behind the bar chatting with everyone then came and stood behind my chair and introduced herself and informed us that she would be taking care of us. Then had the audacity to ask if we needed anything by this time, we had been there at least 45 minutes. The hostess had taken our food and drink orders and we were only waiting on a Bob Marley, which the waitress said was coming right up, which it never did.\\n\\nWe watched a couple that came after us get their food from the male waiter who was working his section. Our waitress was then back at the bar chatting. We looked over at the window and there our food was. The hard-working waiter brought our food over as she stood behind the bar as if we did not exist. Once we received our food, she never came over to ask how everything was. \\n\\nShe walked over to a table and asked how a drink was that she had made for a couple who was sitting at the bar initially. I assume it was not good, so she brought them a Bob Marley over. She walked past our table at least 3 times saying nothing. \\n\\nThe Youngman working behind the bar then came over and asked if we would like to order a drink and we informed him that we ordered a Barb Marley a while ago that we never received. He went and made it right away. \\nAs it relates to the food, I had the curry chicken with rice and peas, my husband had oxtails and our daughter had salmon. That was the saltiest curry chicken I have ever had, as hungry as I was, I pretty much left what they put on the plate.

I really do have a thing for mustard and there seemed to only be a small spread around the cheese dish. \\n\\nThe real kicker on their menu was the dessert.

I love Italian sandwiches and this one hit the spot.

I couldn't get over the fact that the meal comes with so much bread. The tomato soup was perfect on a cold Spring evening (*sigh*...Texas weather).

The good: great beer selection, great specials, good for football, close to my house. The bad: terrible food, iffy service, and it's not local.\\n\\nMy husband and I come here frequently for the Monday night $3 pint special, for the Sunday $3 Texas pint special, and for some $3 \\"fire sale\\" beers. These are all great deals. The Texas one is very straightforward, with a separate paper menu featuring $3 Texas pints only. The Monday night pint night is confusing, and highlights the issues that that Saucer has with service: we've been told by different servers at different times that all of the beers served in pint glasses are $3, that all of the 16 oz beers are $3, and that \\"you just have to ask what's $3.\\" They need to clarify this and come up with a solid rule. The \\"fire sale\\" deal is a daily special on one beer, which changes very frequently; you just have to look in the door and see what's on the chalkboard. Sometimes it's something awful like Shiner Cheer, sometimes it's a great IPA that usually costs $6.\\n\\nAside from these specials, the beer selection is good but not cheap, and because this isn't a local business, I'm more likely to give my money to a local pub if I'm going to be spending $7/pint. \\n\\nThe Saucer is a good place to watch a Monday or Thursday night football game. They have a limited number of TVs (3 I think?), which means that you can watch NFL without being in a \\"sports bar.\\" They also have a large outdoor area that's great in cool weather. \\n\\nSo, the bad stuff. The food is horrific, in my experience, and insanely overpriced. If you're going to eat here, only eat bar food: french fries, chips & queso, nachos. Unfortunately, they'll run you close to $10. Don't bother with anything \\"fancy\\" and do not get the turkey burger or the veggie burger. The service here is decent at best, impossible at worst. We have had servers who forgot our orders repeatedly for 20+ minutes, and not when the place was busy! Some of them are preoccupied flirting with other customers, talking to other waitstaff, etc. We're usually not in any kind of hurry, so whatever, but it can be frustrating.\\n\\nSeveral people have commented on the \\"bad atmosphere\\" at this place. I don't get that. It's no Draught House as far as character goes, but they get the lighting, seating, and TVs right. What they don't get right? THE MUSIC.

Here's the breakdown:\\n\\nFactors: Food, Service, Atmosphere/Ambiance/Decor (I'm going to start calling this AAD, so if you don't get that reference in the future it's because you haven't been following! Tsk tsk), Accessibility, Price.\\n\\nFOOD: I had the California burger with fries. The burger was great! While it wasn't be best I've had, it was definitely an above average burger. I got mine medium-rare and it was done perfectly. The bun is crunchy on the outer edges, and not too thick in the middle such that it would dilute the taste. The amount of guacamole was perfect and well balanced.\\n\\nThe fries were underwhelming. They are thin and there isn't much potato left in the center after frying it. I ate them, but they were average at best. \\n\\nI didn't order the buffalo wings, and that is my biggest regret. I saw another table order them and they looked phenomenal -- good size, came out hot, accompanied by long-sliced carrots and celery,  and were wet, but not drowning in sauce. If I go back--I'm definitely getting these. \\n\\nSERVICE: Meh--it was pretty busy, as it was Friday night at peak dinner time, but service wasn't great at all. At one point the waitress came to our table--I had a mouth full of California burger at the moment, and she asked if we needed anything -- I tried to gesture to my glass of water that hadn't been filled, but she was already gone. I feel like a water refill isn't the kind of thing that really needs asking. It doesn't help that their glasses basically hold several sips of water if they're already full of ice. \\n\\nAtmosphere/Ambiance/Decor (AAD): I ate on the patio, which was very talkative, crowded, had two levels, and basically a dog under every table. It's The floor, railings, and ceiling is basically just made of planks and nails. People seem to love the ambiance here, but I kind of don't know what the big deal is. It's just a screened-in patio with stained floorboards. I mean, it is nice for dog-owners to bring there dogs, and it is bustling, but beyond that, it is pretty much as basic as it gets. Note, I didn't go inside, so I can't comment on that.\\n\\nAlso note, it is accessible for those requiring assistance, as there is a ramp going up to the restaurant. Depending on what part of the restaurant you eat in, you may have to go down a couple steps. Also, the floorboards seemed pretty flat, but I did see a woman trip while she was walking out of the restaurant. Also, it can get really crowded, which may make it more difficult if you need space.\\n\\nPARKING: its crowded and their lot will only fit a handful of cars, but there is a ton of street parking that stretches all the way back into the neighborhood abutting the restaurant.  \\n\\nPrice: I think the California burger (and the rest of their burgers are just a tad overpriced. I mean it was good, but you don't get a ton of food at all. I'd more accurately value them at 10-12 for the burger options. \\n\\nOverall: I'm not anticipating coming back here, but it seems like a fine place to go. If you have a dog that is friendly and calm, this would be a great place--highly recommended if that's what you're looking for."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Bangers is going to be a smash hit!\\n\\nThey advertise having the most beers on tap here in Austin: 103.

Our party met for a late brunch, within the last hour of service.  I tried several items on the brunch buffet and none were worth having seconds of.  They also serve pancakes and eggs to order, but I didin't order any a la carte items.\\n\\nQuite some time later, we met here for happy hour/dinner with friends.  We mostly drank, but before leaving did order the Green Chile Cheeseburger... Eh... had we not needed something to sop up the alcohol in our bloodstreams, we could have passed...  they apparently use (not at all) lean beef, since the \\"juices\\" were running over my hand and down my arm... that part was awesome!\\n\\nI've also been there for a late-late-lunch/early-early-dinner (supper?).  We got there and sat down at almost 3pm.  The server promptly told us that happy hour started in 10 minutes if we wanted to wait to order until then... Well, thank you and YES, we will wait!  (Half-priced drinks and appetizers for happy hour! DUH!)  As a group we ordered 5 different appetizers to start:  \\nBBQ Short Rib Quesadilla - a delightful combination of shredded tangy bbq short rib, creamy and tart cheese and a perfectly toasted flour tortilla, served with their spicy cabbage slaw.\\nBacon Wrapped Quail - by far the favorite at the table - we ended up ordering TWO more orders of this - one for my Granma for \\"dinner\\" and one more for the rest of us to share.\\nChicken Nachitos - These were not a fav... they are kind of a bland concoction of nacho chips (house made), shredded roasted chicken, black beans, american and cojito cheese and jalapenos... not much flavor.\\nSpinach Gorgonzola Ravioli - YUM!  The walnut pesto chipotle cream sauce is delectable (give me the bread and I would CLEAN the plate of this sauce) over the just right flavored pasta packets.\\nCarl Miller's Layered Chunky Queso - while proceeds from this dish benefit the Lone Star Paralysis Foundation, be warned the chunks of pork are LARGE chunks of pork.  Its difficult to scoop out of the dish with a chip - better off cutting it up with a knife/fork before trying to eat it.  Additionally, the queso and guacamole portion of this dish is just eh...\\nBarbacoa Stackers - Now, these were better than the Nachitos.  Similar concept, but made with barbacoa and stacked like tostadas.  Better flavor thanks to the richness of the barbacoa!\\n\\nOn our most recent visit was for a celebration happy hour.  We took advantage of the happy hour and ordered the quesadilla (mentioned previously) which was just as good as we remembered it.  But we also ordered something new to try - the BLT Sliders!  Someone else was having them and they looked really good... THEY WERE!  Grilled pork belly (how could you go wrong!), Greens, Fried green tomatoes and house made pimento cheese.  These were AMAZING!\\n\\nBy the way, their house made pimento cheese with house made nacho chips is amazing!  The chunky combination of cheeses with the pimentos and slightly sweet super crispy thick nacho chips is a flavor combination to die for!\\n\\nWe'll be back - and we WILL keep trying different things... because, all in all - this is a great restaurant with great specials and great drinks!"},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"11400 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"First timer and new location at University.
