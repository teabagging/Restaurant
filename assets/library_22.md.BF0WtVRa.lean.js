Well, ok, you're understaffed...again...no real biggy, I still have an hour or so to kill for lunch, right?  Fast Forward 1 hr, my burger finally gets delivered; however, LM, who placed her order ahead of mine, has to be asked again what she ordered; she obliges, \\"Frida Kahlo Burger.\\"  Mind you, there are only about 10 people left in the joint at this time, as several other people have left, with or without food.  The guy running food, a.k.a. register dude, proceeds to deliver several burgers - one at a time - to a bevy of random customers who came after us (but who also had waited nearly an hour).  Register dude comes back one more time and asks if it was the \\"Frida,\\" right?  Right.  And we proceed to, hypothetically and rhetorically ask, you placed this order initially right? Right (all sarcastic like).  At this point, me and LM cut my burger in half and split it with the accompanying onion rings.  When twenty more minutes pass without the burger named after the uni-browed partner of that great Mexican muralist not gracing our table,  with our shared burger and rings gone, and with our bellies half-full, LM and I decide we must bail, as not to be fired from our jobs.  \\n\\nWe proceed to the counter and tell the new register guy and the old register guy that we have to jet.  The new register guy says LM's burger is almost ready; old register guy says \\"my bad, yo\\" and that it was \\"totes my fault\\" because he did not actually press the button to enter the burger into the system.   LM just asks for her money to be refunded, which is the first thing they did promptly all day [however, with no further offerings (i.e., gratuitous apologies, vouchers, coupons, an offer to DJ our next event, handlebar mustache grooming advice, use of neon sunglasses, etc.)].  \\n\\nAnyway, if you are in the mood for a 1.5 hour lunch of 0.5 burgers and 0.5 orders of onion rings...then go to Mom's - you are sure to be no more disappointed in them than they are in themselves."},{"name":"Moorish Medicine","address":"2440 Wesley Chapel Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I Love this place.

Well a huge let down. It may have the right color but certainly not the right taste, flavor way too faint. Kind of a shame for a tea house that praises itself as the expert in matcha.

The rice itself didn't taste that great either. You can get much better food elsewhere for $16.\\n\\nsweets:\\nanyone who has had authentic Japanese cakes before would agree these pastries here are simply too sweet.

Honestly, half the reviews that are negative here only talk about the service (which in my experience was not bad at all), but if you came for AUTHENTIC food - then you are in the right place. I drove two hours just to try this place after my sister had sent pictures of their raw geoduck sashimi dish that brought fond memories of childhood for me. The best part about eating with my sister and cousin is that we don't let the wallet get in the way and order everything we wanted to try so the breakdown is below (mind you we finished everything as well):\\n\\nRaw Geoduck Sashimi (5/5): Served thinly sliced over ice and with soy sauce and wasabi, this dish was exactly how I remembered at Chinese weddings. They even presented the live geoducks to us beforehand for our approval. For those not in the know, geoducks (pronounced gooey-ducks), are large clams native to Washington state and are in no way, shape or form, related to actual ducks. :)\\n\\nSalt and Pepper Fried Geoduck Belly (5/5): In typical fashion, they batter and fry the parts of the geoduck that can not be eaten raw. This is done in the usual Canto fashion with a nice, softer batter and garnished with hot peppers. Delicious!\\n\\nMinced Crab and Fish Maw Soup (5/5): This is another common dish served at weddings, very similar to an what Americans would call egg drop soup. Make sure to ask for the red vinegar to mix in with the broth! They do not skimp on the crab meat here, and as a result, this soup is filled to the brim with that crab essence.\\n\\nRoast Duck (4/5): Typical duck that you would see hanging in the Chinatown restaurant windows. While they achieved a nice crunch to the skin, there was not a lot of meat and it was on the oily side.\\n\\nClams and Vermicelli served on the Half-Shell (4/5): This was another unique dish that I had to try. The clams were cooked just right so that they were not too chewy and adding the vermicelli was a darn good idea. I just couldn't help but feel like they were bribing us with sesame oil for this dish again.\\n\\nCanadian Crab with Sticky Rice (4/5): This is another classic dish typically served at weddings. New Golden Gate did this right, and the freshness of the crab clearly was evident.\\n\\nStir Fried Watercress (3/5): Typical stir fried watercress dish, flavor was decent, but way too much oil for my taste.\\n\\nIn summary, come here for an authentic experience, but don't be surprised when you do not get the level of service typical of fine dining establishments. It also helps to bring a Cantonese or Mandarin speaker!"},{"name":"Hops N Scotch","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"My first visit back in October, I sat with a friend at the bar and ordered food.

In all honesty, we should not have been charged after we already had consumed the drink after being told that it came with the meal.  In any case, the pulled pork was terrific, with great BBQ sauce.  It came with two sides.  The mac and cheese was great, and was a very generous portion.  The bean mixture was OK, but I would have preferred all baked beans and a different sauce for them.  The cole slaw (\\"non-spicy\\" choice) was still quite spicy and not to the liking of my girlfriend (or mine, as she shared a bit of it).  It was not creamy and tart, which would have been my personal preference.  I laughed at the name of the restaurant, the suggestive logo, and the old pin-up girlie magazine covers on the wall, though some people (like my mother!) might not care for it.  My girlfriend and I did enjoy some good \\"boner\\" jokes as part of the experience.

There, I usually get the Oreo Slush with Oreo pieces, or the Thai tea, and both are great! I love that KFT has really sweet boba, and that they give plenty of it in each of their drinks. When we stumbled upon this tea house/restaurant right around the corner from our apartment, I knew we should try it out. Last week, we both got the  Lavender milk tea with boba, and neither of us was all that impressed. In fact, my daughter felt that the lavender flavor was much too intense, as did I, and the bubbles  were not real sweet, like we prefer them. Sadly, there was very little boba in our drinks, and the bubbles lacked the chewiness we are used to. A few days later, we decided to get the rose milk teas with boba, and fortunately, this time, the drinks were so much better!!! The rose was far less over-powering, with just enough of it to make our teas more interesting. We also thought that our drinks had way more bubbles than  before. On our next visit, I would love to see if they could do an Earl Grey and Lavender one, because with blending  them together, I feel like the strength of the \\nlavender part would become Bar it's seriouslyg milder.  At some point soon, we plan to have dinner here as well, since the dishes are Japanese inspired, and the menu is pretty extensive. Items include everything from miso soup with lobster meat, to porks and sushi hand rolls, and entrees such as sesame crusted  tuna and green tea dusted salmon. Dishes are pricy, so be prepared! This place serves small plates and cafe treats, like the cute  little turtles and bear shaped breads,  and the atmosphere is inviting too. After we dine at the restaurant, we will give an update.

The standard of this place is simple: Food that's true to their culture. It's what I get when I go home, it's what I know and understand to be good food. And when I see elderly Mexican people in here, who don't speak English, whose roots are clearly in Mexico and they're sitting at this little restuarant getting their menudo for breakfast, it just further confirms that this is the good stuff.

They are ALWAYS out of ingredients, and often won't tell you that key ingredients are missing from a salad you ordered until halfway through making it. So you have to either accept that, or ask them to start over and get something different which will get you major eye rolls. Also, I should know better by now, but their dressing measurements are way off. A medium will often get you something that resembles a lettuce soup. \\nGet a better staff in here sweetgreen- this place is making your brand look bad. We live above it, and I still think we're going to make the walk to the fort point one and avoid coming here anymore."},{"name":"Anna Bannanas St. Johns","address":"8716 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"They have really nice bagel sandwiches here which is mostly why I drop by.

The food was delivered quickly from the sushi bar and tapas served fresh and hot. I wanted to like the food more, but the sushi was average at best. We tried the Fantasy Roll (shrimp tempura w/cucumber and topped with salmon and tuna), and the Tuna Lovers Roll (spicy tuna & tempura flakes topped with tuna, white tuna and avocado). The tuna roll was noticeably small especially for the price. There was more rice than fish in each roll, and the slices of fish on top of the rolls were thin and almost non-existent. The crispy beef tapas dish was satisfying. Although I only tasted vegetables, and no crab, the crab claw spring roll was fried perfectly and served in shot glasses with a sprig of cilantro and sweet chili sauce at the bottom. Dessert was a bright spot - the green tea cheesecake delivered.

The last time I went to the Buckhead location, something about the service ticked me off, and I didn't go back for a year.  This morning, my husband talked me into giving them another try.  I went in ready to make a new start, but after today's experience ... I don't think we are going back.  The pancakes came out just slightly warm to touch, but cool to eat.  And on a cold day, the last thing I wanted was cool pancakes.  But the server never came back to check on us, it wasn't even that busy, he was just chatting away with other servers.  After my husband was nearly finished eating his meal, I finally had to ask someone to get our server. I asked if I can get a substitute for half of the pancakes, I asked for a biscuit and grits instead.  That didn't seem like it was going to be a problem, but when the bill came, they charged me for the extra grits.  And no one apologized to me about the pancakes.  In fact, our server ignored us and tried not to make eye contact the rest of our visit, not even asking how everything was the second time my food came out.  It's weird, because it's not like I was snobby about it, I approached it in a nice way.  In my opinion, servers need to care about their customers, care if they are happy with the food.

Ask for it cooked well-done/a little longer than usual if you want it to be closer to the consistency of a beef burger (otherwise it sorta falls apart).\\n\\nService is great, bathrooms are clean, atmosphere is fun, price is really reasonable.

On the corner of this old East Hastings stress is King's Cafe. This particular Cafe wasn't anything spectacular, but it was hearty food in a modest restaurant. I can't believe Red Wagon kept the exterior and interior of the old Cafe and added their own flavours into the mix.\\n\\nThe first thing we ordered was the Crisp Pork Belly Sandwich with pickled vegetable, jalape√±o, cilantro, mayo, and all that in a baguette. So in other words, take out all the Vietnamese meat from the  B√°nh m√¨ and replace it with a fatty pork belly. Coming from a Chinese background I would imagine the pork belly to resemble the Chinese version where the skin is extra crispy and the meat was dry. The Red Wagon version is more juicy. One bite will ensure the oil, fat, and flavours to ooze out.\\n\\nNext up, Pulled Pork Pancakes. Jack Daniels Maple Syrup with Buttermilk Pancakes layered with pulled pork. WTF, maple syrup with pulled pork? Sweet and savory to me is like a man in women's clothes. You're confused as to see if she's hot or not. I was already suspicious last time hee brought home Lindt chocolate with sea salt. This just surpass that on a experimental level food wise.\\n\\nFluffy buttery pancakes with pulled pork in between it. All of that sitting on the bed of maple syrup.\\n\\nI sliced a piece of pancake, pushed the pulled pork on the fork, and slid the combo onto the river of maple syrup. The first taste was like the time I ever had red wine. I tried to savor the moment. I was dazed, and confused. How can these two things that I would never imagined pared up be so good together. The pancake itself was a vehicle for the syrup. The pulled pork was soft. The oil syrup and was just dripping out as I was devouring it. I felt so dirty eating this but I couldn't stop. We kept sliding our fork of pork and pancake across the plate to soak up the syrup and before we know it, the river of syrup dried up. We sat there looking at each other, and not proceeding to eat more. I politely asked the waitress to bring us some more syrup. We continue to wait and finally the syrup jar came. We refilled the plate with the goodness and continued to empty the plate until we couldn't eat anymore.\\n\\nFrom one perspective, I feel dirty for eating here. Everything is so deliciousness, but if it came with a Nutrition Facts Chart, I would have a heart attack just reading it. When I am slicing the pancake, gathering the pulled pork, or gripping the pork belly sandwich, I am in the zone. I don't care about my health.

We went on a Tuesday night, there was a standard crowd than you'd expect on a Tuesday, nothing crazy. Yet, when trying to close our tab to go eat dinner, it took over 15 minutes for us to get the tab. Our waiter, Eric, was slow. Slow to take our orders, slow to bring our food out; he didn't even come to check how things were and I had to hunt him down to place a 2nd drink order. The thing that really set us off was when he just brought the check without asking if we wanted dessert or anything else. \\n\\nWhile the food was good, we probably will not be returning because dealing with the staff at Abby Lane was such a frustrating experience."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"-Good service (efficient, friendly, attentive)\\n-Food: soggy pizza, too oily/flavorless pasta (clam sauce), tasteless appetizer (mussels)\\n\\n*They do fill up your water oftthough...\\n*i would not come back here."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"An amazing little restaurant right in the heart of the north end.

This is a staple for me.  Tucked in an unassuming corner between a BC liquor store and a dollar store, it's a quaint space that has enough private sitting areas to make it restful.  \\n\\nPersonally, given that this town has more sushi restaurants per capita (5 that are a stone's-throw away within 1km of each other!), what does it for me to make this one my go-to are 1. the sushi and food - quality; and 2. the owners, Mike and Tiffany.  They've been running this place since I moved into the area, and they are incredible people.  They are friendly and make you feel like you're a patron at Cheers.  \\n\\nMike trained at a sushi restaurant in Japan (I think Tokyo, he said) and the two of them speak Japanese to each other.  Having lived in Japan for a few years I crave real Japanese food sometimes; they know their Japan cuisine, and I find I can get authentic sushi staples (mostly maki) and his own great creations.  Some fresh ones (Tiger roll with fresh shrimp and yams - a smooth, buttery flavour, and my pig-out fave - the Steffie Roll: a deep-fried gyoza roll!) which make me want to experiment at each visit.  Their hot dishes are quite good comfort food as well.  My recommendation for a bowl of happy is the Kitsune Udon - a blend of miso and sweetness that is very surprisingly balanced and rich.  \\n\\nI find groups come here after a cycling trip or coming back from some bird watching at the Reifel Bird Sanctuary.  Either way it's a welcome respite where you always feel welcomed by those two.  Believe me, if you come twice, no matter where you're from, they'll remember your face and ask you how you're doing since then."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Unsanitary practices will lead to people getting SICK!

Everything came out great, each plate with great flavors. The mac and chesse is a must if you ever visit. I was skeptical at first because I like mac and cheese a certain way so I ordered the regular bowl. It was very cheesy as creamy and it was served in a unique way; the penne were all turned upright so that when they poured the cheese over, the cheese would also get inside the actual pasta which I think is very clever. The chicken slider was so good; it was gone in a couple seconds. The onion straws were perfectly cooked and the sauce paired nicely.

I've never had giardiniera in a pita/gyro before, and I didn't know that it was going to be spicy (I don't do spicy) so I wasn't too sure that I was going to like it.

Also I really wanted just rice and beans, but it is crazy to charge $3-4 for each.  $8-9 for rice and beans?! I mean Mexico would be making a killing if that were the case.  It's just rice and beans, it's like what you buy at the grocery store to serve the masses on a limited budget.  Locos pantalones.\\n\\nNo dessert. Sad. They should consider adding a small dessert menu. Just throwing it out there: homemade churros + chocolate sauce, flan, banuelos, arroz de leche or some horchata bread pudding. \\n\\nA solid 3.5 stars, but I rounded up because I'm really pulling for them to survive."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"First off, this is seriously my favorite name for a business.  It just rolls right off the tongue when you say it, doesn't it?\\n\\nJesus, I'm still full from this meal. Gladys has done well for herself since breaking up with the Pips.  I can't fully explain why I enjoyed myself so much on my visit here, but I did.  Ok, now please indulge me with my obvious and cheesy references to Gladys Knight lyrics throughout this review. I will mark them with a * if you just want to skip over it.\\n\\nFor my main event I ordered the \\"Midnight Train\\", their famous chicken & waffles dish.  It definitely took me back to a simpler place and time.* The meal was great. I wouldn't say it was the best thing that ever happened to me*, but it was close. For reals, the fried chicken was flavorful, crispy, and large. Drizzle some syrrrup over it and you're golden.  The waffle was so tasty, I may have made a \\"pita-like\\" waffle-and-chicken-drizzled-in-syrup type of sandwich.  I don't blame you if that image left you goin' back to find* the nearest garbage can to vom.  I also ordered a side of mac and cheese that was so deliciously greasy my forehead was triumphantly glistening. I know, this all sounds pretty bad, I felt every beat of my heart* getting slower and slower after this meal.\\n\\nI'm glad my good friend took me here, probably because he wanted me to stop talking about it.  But that's what friends are for.*  The staff was incredibly friendly and gave me a to-go cup of sweet tea complete with the Gladys Knight logo on it. And yeah, I kept that precious gift, it's sitting on my desk now.\\n\\nOddly, I love that the menu is written in musical showcase terms referring to her career.  I already mentioned the Midnight Train which was under \\"headliners\\", but also the appetizers are called \\"opening acts\\". Likewise, the traditional southern dishes are under \\"grammy winners\\", and desserts are under \\"encores\\". Cheesy, but I'm down with that noise.\\n\\nI knew it would be a good time when I walked in and heard the Luther Vandross slow jam \\"You are my lady\\" playing over the speakers.  Nothing but classic R&B to boogie to in this joint.  It has a classic diner feel with red leather couches in a mildly dark but pleasant atmosphere. I'm definitely a fan.  Do your thing Gladys!

And the waits were comparable (waited 2 hours at Franklin, waited 1.75 at la Barbecue), so pick your (delicious fatty) poison.\\n\\n**Closed on Monday and Tuesday. Franklin's is closed on Monday, too. \\n\\n- THE WAIT + SPACE + SURVIVOR'S GUIDE:\\nWe arrived around 10:45am (they open at 11) and were about 20th in line. We received our food 2 hours later -- which is where the main crux of my wait for la Barbecue was. The wait seems to be more of a product of their inefficiency (they are in a truck, after all) of their service rather than the volume of people waiting -- there's basically only one person who slices meat and takes orders. \\n\\nThe seating is picnic table style in the parking lot -- which is fun since you get to interact with all the others waiting. Grab a table under a tent (there are only a few) to hide yourself from the elements. Those less fortunate were left eating ribs in the rain, although it didn't stop anybody.\\n\\nGroups of people tend to 'save' tables but it's honestly not worth it as the ratio of time taken to eat your meat (really freakin' quick after you've been waiting for your food for 2 hours) vs time taken to get served is small enough where you'll probably be able to find a seat once you get your food.\\n\\nFREE BEER! \\n\\nFREE (?) PORT-A-POTTY!\\n\\nThere was also a guy playing live music while we waited, which was nice.\\n\\n- FOOD:\\nPrices:\\nBRISKET - $20.00 LB \\nPULLED PORK - $17.98 LB\\nTURKEY - $17.98 LB\\nSAUSAGE  - $4.25 A LINK (MADE IN HOUSE)\\nPORK RIBS - $17.98 LB (4 RIBS IN A LB, 12 BONES IN A RACK)\\nBEEF RIBS -  $22.00 LB (EACH RIB WEIGHS ABOUT 1.5 LBS EACH) \\n\\nWe got:\\n- 1.5 lbs of brisket - Delicious. Go for the fattier cut, the leaner one was not as spectacular. Miles behind Franklin, though. \\n- A rack of pork ribs - tasty, but not memorable.\\n- La Chopped sandwich - GREAT way to have the beef with really tangy and delicious coleslaw. I'd recommend just getting a beef rib, because who am I kidding I had no space for bread in my stomach.\\n- El Sancho with sausage/pulled pork and red onions - delicious combination, I think the sausage would otherwise be dry on its own without the pulled pork carrying it. \\n- Frito pie - Like nachos, but with fritos instead!\\n- Bean/corn - A humble way to bring some freshness into our meal.\\n\\nBest part of the meal was...the potato salad. It was DELICIOUS, light, and vinegar-y. We were shocked and regretted getting a large size of it. We loved it so much we packed it home and ended up eating it while waiting in line for Franklin 2 days later."},{"name":"Andrea's Pizza","address":"883 Main St","city":"Winchester","stars":"4","text":"Once again i ordered some specifics on a lg roast beef sub and it was done perfectly....highly recommend"},{"name":"Hollywood Casino Columbus","address":"200 Georgesville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Casino is very nice, but don't expect to get treated like a gentleman.

We ended up in a corner by the door, which wasn't that nice since the waiting bench was directly behind us, and our waiter complained that the people in the booth in front of is were trying to dip out on the bill, luckily for him they didn't leave b/c he would've had to pay for it (boooo). \\nThe food: We started with the jerk chicken egg rolls which were awesome, but came with ranch sauce, what's up with that? And we both ordered the midnight train, which is 4 wings and a waffle. Both of us truly enjoyed our meals. Service was a little slow, and the bathrooms were small.

We even ordered a second serving of it.... ahhahaha no shame. I think the fries by themselves would've been less impressive (but still good, don't get me wrong). The addition of the eggs and the b√©arnaise sauce just rocketed this dish to a whole 'nother level.

I also requested a half order of fries, which I got for free just for being a first-timer, which was nice.

The building has three doors leading into a tiny room with two counters--one of which would seat about three people, if they didn't mind a crush of sweaty armpits leaning around them because that is also where you have to order and pay.  The second counter also seats two to three people, but one seat is missing, although I guess you could just stand over the pole while you eat your food and web surf.  There isn't much wall space for leaning against, since it's mostly doors in there.   Very rapidly there was no place to stand and wait for my food and the patio was full too, so I went outside to a picnic table to wait--but there wasn't any kind of pager or basic loudspeaker, so I had to keep hopping up to go back inside and see if they had called my name.

Our party did not come in all at once which I understand can make things tricky, but when the bartender came to the table, he would often ask the newcomer what they'd like and start to walk away instead of checking on everybody at once.

Anyhow, time passed, I went to play a driving game (they have some fun arcade games), came back, and the food had arrived. Upon chowing down I quickly discovered ham in the burrito -we didn't notice the menu said bacon AND ham. We just ate around it and didn't say anything. It's not that we felt personally offended, it's not that big of a deal to pick out the ham. After all, we should have noticed it on the menu. It just bugs me that there are people in the world like this. The bartender either didn't say anything on purpose to get one over on us because he doesn't like vegetarians, he doesn't know his menu, or he just wasn't paying attention/didn't care.

Before deciding on coming here we had another place in mind, the regular place Black and Blue. I did my research, i looked online, i asked around...then i started to worry. The feedback i got back from my friends were not very good. I even had one friend saying that her meal was over 300$ and it was only comparable to the keg or worse. Don't get me wrong I love the keg, but this is top dollar steak so i expect a top dollar meal! We started with the calamari, tenderloin carpaccio, and black & blue ahi tuna. We enjoyed all 3, however there are two items i can compare to Black & blue. At Black & Blue the carpaccio and calamari is a better deal (cheaper), more flavourful, not as plain as you would get here (they have capers on their carpaccio!!! Also its all in the seasoning). At Black & blue The plump calamari fills the plate here it just fills a bowl, here the carpaccio breaks when you try to pull it off the place because its way too thin and doesn't have enough substance to be able to eat a full piece at a time. It drives me crazy! I'm not sure if would come back for appies. I think i would just go for the kill and order the steak. I'm not sure if my friends visited on an off day (which would bother me, because the restaurants i always frequent are the ones that are consistent...consistency in service and food quality are very important to me) but the porterhouse was AMAZING. It was the best piece of meat that ive had in a long time! And i frequently eat steak. The short loin was juicy, succulent, tender, the tenderloin was melt in your mouth tender and juicy. IT was so good i cannot NOT write a review about it. I am excited to be able to come here again and praying that it will be just as delicious the next time. The one thing that really bothered me about this place is that we arrived at 15:00 planning on doing dinner as well as happy hour, unfortunately unlike other places for happy hour you can ONLY order off the happy hour menu and not anything else. We had to go back and walk around the mall for another 2 hours before we could eat and we were already hungry. I wish they would have specified that online. Happy hour isn't worth it if its so restricted and the only thing we wanted on that menu was the black and blue tuna. We ended up just paying the full price during dinner.

It is still awkward to move from the new section to the old. It is becoming a denser urban joined to tawdry suburban shopping center.

Seems like a good sign, I thought. Shortly after that, things started to go awry.\\n\\nFirst, there was a miscommunication between the hostess and the employee who was seating people, which resulted in another party of two, who arrived after us, getting the table that was supposed to be ours (for the record, this was not the hostess' fault; we heard her tell the seater that we were next, but he seated the other party instead). A few minutes later, we got the next available table, a high-top. Not what we would've preferred, but acceptable. This in itself wouldn't have thrown off the evening.\\n\\nI ordered a 'build-your-own-burger' with bacon and a fried egg, specifically requesting that the egg be cooked 'over hard', so that the yolk didn't run (a big turnoff for me). My companion ordered fish-- I think it was the haddock.\\n\\nWhen the food came to the table, I instantly noticed two things-- yolk running down the side of my burger onto the plate, and a host of toppings on the burger that I did not order-- lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles. I picked them off and decided I'd eat the burger, even with the runny yolk. But I was curious-- if this was listed as a 'build-your-own-burger', on which each topping was an additional $0.75, was my burger going to be $3 over what I expected because of the 4 extra toppings? We asked our server about this, and she explained that lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles came on the burger automatically. Huh? How does this make sense on a 'build-your-own-burger', when lettuce, tomatoes and onions are listed among the 'Choose your toppings' items on the menu? How would anybody know to expect those items on the burger, when the entire concept of 'build-your-own-burger' is typically (and when I say 'typically', I mean pretty much ALWAYS) to start with a bare burger-- a blank slate-- and then add to it only what you wish? I mean, what would happen if you ordered a build-your-own-burger, with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles? Would you get double of each? Our server seemed unable to relate to my confusion about this. She acted like this was normal, this is how everyone does it, explaining it with a mouth that was smiling, but eyes that shot daggers.\\n\\nIn their defense, she did return and inform us that because it was not cooked to my request, the fried egg would be removed from the bill. However, I had to take her word on this, because just after we paid for the meal, we realized that we had never seen an itemized bill. Was the egg in fact taken off? Had we actually not paid an extra $3 on the burger? Hell, was it even OUR bill that we received, and not someone else's in error? We had no way of knowing. Without an itemized bill, there's any number of things that could happen without a customer being aware of it, and that is a big deal. ***Every person considering patronizing the Route 1 Grill House should be aware of this.***\\n\\nAside from the negatives, my burger itself was tasty, we also had a chicken tenders appetizer we enjoyed, and my companion was satisfied with her meal. However, she was even more upset about the errors with my meal (and the seating mix-up) than I was-- and whereas I felt that I might be willing to consider giving the Grill House another shot, in case we were just there on an off night, she was not."},{"name":"Floataway Cafe","address":"1123 Zonolite Rd NE, Ste 15","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"FOOD::\\nI came to Floataway Caf√© with a girlfriend for a night of wine and chit chats. Nothing either of us ordered really stood out to me. For appetizer, we ordered a large plate of calamari to share between two people. The portion was GINORMOUS and we couldn't even finish. I ended up bringing more than half of it home. The taste, like I said, didn't stand out to me. It was just regular-ol-calamari and it could've use an extra pinch of flavor. We then ordered the burrata, and this may be my favorite dish of all. The grilled sourdough bread was crunchy and was the perfect match for the melt-in-your-mouth burrata. I'm not one for heavy cheeses, and that's why burratas are the best for me. For my entr√©e, I ordered a plate of pasta because pastas are to die for! I got the black fettucine pasta, served with squid, clam, and shrimp. My dish was tasty, but overall a plain Jane--there just wasn't enough punch! The sauce tasted tomato-y and that was basically it. Again, my entr√©e was good, just didn't have the Wow factor. What did have a wow-factor was the desert. I got the warm toffee pudding and my friend the hazelnut pots de cr√®me (at least that's what I think she got). My toffee pudding was splendid! It was so creamy and it just melted in my mouth. It wasn't too sweet; the mix of vanilla gelato with caramel was just right. \\n\\nSERVICE::\\nI came to Floataway Caf√© on a weeknight and it wasn't very busy at all. We were one of four tables, I believe. Our waitress was kind and attentive. Answered all of our questions and gave recommendations. Nice!\\n\\nATMOSPHERE&LOCATION::\\nLocated very close to Two Urban Licks. One thing that I loved about Floataway Caf√© is the restaurant's ambience!

I hadn't eaten all day and I was STARVING. When the waiter came back over I ordered a Dickie's Ginger Beer, which I enjoyed very much, it was definitely different than most Ginger Beers I've tried recently, more lemony, less spicy but still very, very refreshing. For foods I ordered A LOT and boy was it worth it. I started with the Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes with sausage and oh my god were they good, thick, light, buttery, syrupy all around greatness, now that I've had the Wagon's pancakes I won't be able to order pancakes at any other diner, they were by far the best I've ever had. Up next I ordered the Pemberton Beef Burger with smoked mushrooms it was also jam packed with mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles all on a freshly baked brioche bun, it was such a friggin' amazing burger! Lastly I ordered the house-made BBQ Brisket with jalape√±o cornbread and home-fries topped with two eggs cooked however you choose, I got them cooked over easy, this was the highlight of the whole meal for me, the brisket was EXTREMELY tender, the BBQ sauce was SO TASTY, the cornbread was PERFECT, everything on the plate went together so well, you HAVE TO order this dish! To top it all off I ordered a piece of Ginger Pear Pie, it was fresh and delicious just like everything else on the menu!\\n\\nThe kitchen staff at The Red Wagon clearly care about every meal they send out, every dish they send out is of the highest quality, and from what I've read they CONSISTENTLY AWESOME.

The manager was apologetic about it, which he should be, but kind of brushed it off, saying something about how they fillet the salmon on site. \\n\\nAnyway, the meal was really surprisingly enjoyable for a hotel restaurant. Looooved the Bourbon-Chocolate Pecan Pie a-la-mode for dessert. Comforting hot-cold combo. \\n\\nWe had a very sweet server who was totally on point and I really want to come back to try their Sunday brunch build your own Bloody Mary (only $3.47-steal!!).\\n\\nBest thing is that my meal was free because I am a member of Team Shula. Via e-mail received a coupon for 1 free entree (anything on menu) with the purchase of a full price entree. Coupon is good for up to a month after your b-day.

I was SOO excited to finally be taking a friend to try this place out. We got there and the atmosphere was great and comfortable. Then, we got our appetizer. It was a queso fundido (queso flameado). I love my Latin food and cheese but this was not good. The cheese was very hard and chewy but we figured it was just a mistake and didn't think anything of it. Next, another personal favorite, mole with chicken! It looked so delicious and then I tasted it. It was quite bitter and the rice was plain and had no flavors to balance it out.\\n\\nSo we decided that the desserts looked SOOO good and we HAD to try that too. Well, that was also a bad idea. The tres leches, which is a cake that should be soaked in milk, was DRY and almost tatted stale. The one thing we did manage to enjoy were the different ice cream flavors.\\n\\nFinally, what lead me to giving this restaurant 1 star is the fact that I finally decided to bring up how stale the tres leches was, to my waitress, and all she did was look at the dessert and shrug a little bit after saying, \\"I'll tell the chef.\\" There were many other things I hadn't brought up to her that night because my friend gets pretty embarrassed. Also, the service was not very great. It would take a LONG time for our waitress to come and check on us and my friend and I constantly had to ask a busser for our waitress, the dessert options, and our check.

I would say that if I were to add up what we have for a lunch or dinner the cost would be around 2-3 times what we actually spent.\\n\\nI would say that Su Su is not only a great restaurant in the neighborhood, they are quickly becoming a desitination location, attracting customers from Boston to RI."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"By far my favorite restaurant in the North End!

The Super Trucker came with a lot of stuff, but the pork belly stood out. Overall, the food is always consistently good, but pretty greasy, as others have mentioned.\\n\\nThe service was good. Our server came around often to refill our coffee and water and cleared plates away as we emptied them.

The Waiter Adrian brought it promptly as well as our Smoked Salmon Bruschetta appetizer which was delicious. \\n\\nWe ordered the Rack of lamb for myself which was done perfectly to medium rare and the Butternut Squash Ravioli for my wife which was insanely good.

Upon reading over the menu, we spotted Jerk and BBQ wings with fries and lemonade/tea for $7.99, but our excitement was quickly shattered when we were informed that they were out of wings.  We debated leaving but our server convinced us to stay and my party of four we ordered the Jerk Chicken plate (jerk chicken, rice, cabbage and fried plantains).  We started our meal with a chicken patty and beef patty. Once again everything was seasoned well but a few of my pieces were dry but flavorful.  Thanks goodness for the side of jerk sauce to dip.  We had lemonade to drink and it was so good, but it did not look like lemonade (favored a tea & lemonade mix).  They make the lemonade in-house as well.

My tortellini with Bolognese was overcooked and the sauce was bland. There was nothing quality about this food. I rarely feel so harsh about a place but when you leave feeling like you wasted money, it is disappointing. This is one situation where we should have just sent the entrees back. Overcooked pasta in itself is not good and I am not sure I believe it was home made. It looked like the tiny tortellini you often get in the grocery store, not the bigger tortellini that is more common in homemade pasta. If you can make your own pasta, you should also be able to make good sauces. Yes the portions are big but so what. We ate a quarter of it and gave the rest away.

We were a party of 20, but the place was practically empty. I am very patient and understanding, as I've worked in food service for many years before finding my passion working with children. The waitress waited until 8:00pm to take our orders. She took it upon herself to \\"hold\\" our orders without telling or asking anyone. I didn't get my food until 9:05pm. The ice cubes had melted in our drinks. The waitress and manager were unresponsive. We had to find the waitress if we needed anything; it seemed she was always in the back for long periods of time--maybe she was cooking the food, too! Honestly, there should have been, at least, two servers working a party of 20. It seems as if an inexperienced management team set her up for failure and set us up for an unsatisfactory experience. When she started bring our food out, the manager who helped her was as hands-off and in the cut as possible. It didn't work; the waitress forgot to bring rice, sauces and what-have-you. Some of the meals were cold. During the meal she had trouble remembering to bring requests to the table. We were so sleepy by the time we finished our meal and some of us had left. It was an awful birthday celebration. I felt disrespected and disappointed. I went to the bar to pay my bill, because I could see receiving payment was going to be a problem for this waitress. I told the bartender about my experience and ask to speak to a manager. He told me that there \\"really\\" wasn't a manager there. I asked, \\"So, there's no MOD tonight?\\" Then he said the woman who barely helped our server was \\"kind of\\" an assistant manager. I said, \\"Oh, so she's the MOD.\\" He agreed and said he kind of was, too. Our grat was for 20%. I told him 20% was for EXCELLENT service, not what we had experienced. I asked if he would lessen the grat to 15% or 18%, a reasonable request. He said that \\"unfortunately\\" he couldn't, because when the reservation was made the person was made aware of the grat and was okay with it. But does he not realize that the birthday girl didn't realize that her party would be paying for a waitress who would hide in the back and an avoidant manager? And why pretend that there were no MODs? He seemed to have a problem remembering his and the other manager's names when I asked for them. This experience was unforgivable. I won't be back.

I was so used to it nice and thick with flavor. but now its practically transparent and absorb soy sauce like a sponge, not offering great taste. i even ordered the eel and avocado roll and im actually so sure that they didnt put any in it! either that, its a tiny piece with sauce covered in it. \\n\\nSusu had became a huge disappointment for me and its really making me think twice than to go back for a long time. the servers didnt seem to change, i had the same service as before, and it looks like the owners were still there. perhaps its the chefs that are deciding to take short cuts or being told to? who knows, i hope they change it back to the right portion so i can rely on this place. \\n\\nBecause that this was my favorite place for AYCE sushi, i have to bring it down to 2 stars to have them notice."},{"name":"Chuck's Restaurant","address":"68 Maple St","city":"Danvers","stars":"3.5","text":"Chuck's is solid diner food.

Bummer. I normally am extremely understanding when the server is so-so. However, when a menu has entrees that run between $17-$24, I have to say that the server is a very important part of the experience.  \\n\\nI took in the whole scenario. I saw that there were only 2 servers there, and one was the owner. I noted that they were making drinks, waiting tables, bussing tables, and disappearing in to the kitchen, maybe helping in there as well. I also noticed that there were only about 5 tables at 7pm. Not good so far.\\n\\nWe ordered drinks and he was unfamiliar with the drink recipes, as well as what some of the liquor brands were. He took our wine glasses away when we had not told him if we were having wine with dinner.  \\n\\nWhen our server took our orders, he went around the table, instead of asking the women first.\\n\\nThey have salmon on their menu. I asked where the salmon was from. The server said he did not know, and instead of finding out, he went off (trying to be funny) about this not being out of a Portlandia scene,  and he does not know what the fish's name is etc. Haha.. ok, but, salmon is pretty pedestrian, as far as knowing where it comes from. And, I would hope it would be from the Pacific NW, and not the Atlantic ocean.. Since his answer was vague, I decided against it. \\n\\nHe's a man without conviction. He's a man that doesn't know. \\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmcA9LIIXWw\\n\\nI ordered their still to-die-for butternut squash ravioli.  The sauce is creamy and very flavorful. The raviolis are cooked nicely. It's a good healthy serving. I could lick the plate, ok?? I also ordered their delicious-fresh casear salad. \\n\\nThe server's arm would block my view off and on during all the courses of the meal. In other words, he was picking up the plates from wherever he stood, vs. walking around from behind you.\\n\\nThe actual food itself is still wonderful.  I never get dessert at restaurants but I always get their coconut pie. The crust was a little hard to cut but it did not interfere with the dreamy flavors otherwise.\\n\\nAll the stars go for the food here. I think the chef could teach the server a few things to make this a more smoother dining experience.

Happy hour prices are great and definitely make this place worth a stop!\\n\\nMy favorite HH offerings are the duck fat fries and crispy brussels sprout leaves! I always get these when I come for happy hour and have never been disappointed. My favorite drinks are the Blanche margarita (blood orange frozen margarita) and Charlotte's web.\\n\\nGreat parking, good service, and a nice outdoor seating area make this a great happy hour find!"},{"name":"Lupo","address":"869 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Walking up the steps into Lupo you get the impression of a freshly redone Victorian house. White walls hold pieces of abstract art. Tables are small and clustered together. The place feels crowded until you sit and begin your meal - suddenly you feel like you can tune out all the babble while at your own cozy table.\\n\\nThe waiter, who was French (real French) came by with a warm smile and genuine enthusiasm. Placing a small dish of complimentary assorted olives, he declared \\"to inspire you\\". Nice.\\n\\nFor antipasti, we started with the Prosciutto Pizzetta with caramelized onion and rucula. This was fantastic and a shame to have to share, but it definitely got us excited about the next courses. Next up was the Ricotta Gnocchi with braised pork cheeks and porcini mushrooms. This was so flavourful and tender, with just the right texture.\\n\\nFor mains, my partner went with the special, filet mignon, while I went with the lamb shank ossobucco served with a lemon saffron risotto. The rich, tender lamb was nicely paired with the bright flavour of the risotto.  The filet mignon was perfect. One bite and my eyes widened and it took a lot of willpower to resist my partner's offers of more helpings. I was, after all, supposed to be committed to my own meal. \\n\\nThe wine list here is short, but good. I would say it's succinct. They simply don't put crappy wines on the menu. I went with a glass of Nero D'avola (Sicily) while he chose Mission Hill Pinot Noir.  \\n\\nDessert didn't disappoint either. I didn't get to sample my date's chocolate pistachio tart but my Grand Marnier creme br√ªl√©e was terrific. Blackberries hidden throughout was a nice touch. \\n\\nThis was a wonderful place to eat. I won't be ordering the lamb again, good as it was, as I'm just too spoiled with the bolder flavours of Greek-style lamb. I am definitely going back again and again until I've eaten everything on their menu at least once. My partner and I have promised we'll be eating here once a month. \\n\\nService was excellent, ambience was relaxed elegance.\\nI felt overdressed in my black cocktail dress, dangling earrings and high heels. Most of the diners simply wore dress pants and nice sweaters. \\n\\nThe tab came to $ 134.00 before tip. This included 4 courses, wine for each, and a beer."},{"name":"Abby Lane","address":"255 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here Fri 9th November before a Lewis Black show.

Tucked away in a nondescript location and perhaps a bit overshadowed by it's more famous neighbor Imperial Fez, Win definitely has some things working against it, but once you taste their food, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nFood: Let me start by saying Indonesian food is really unique, it's a hodge podge of Indian, East Asian, and South East Asian with its own island twist. We started off with the Satay because we were told by the hosts that it was one of their specialties. I have to say these satays (we got lamb and chicken) were really delectable. They were grilled to perfection and seasoned really well - the peanut sauce it came with was a perfect compliment to the satay. After recommendations from Julie, one of the hosts, we both ended up getting the Rendang as our main course, which is basically a braised short rib off the bone in a savory sauce, with asparagus, fried rice cake, and some other veggies. This entree was fantastic! The beef was super tender and for the most part very juicy, even though as I got towards the center of mine it became a little dry, but thankfully there was tons of sauce to make up for it. I thought the fried rice cake was a very unique touch and while at first I would've rather had just a standard scoop of Jasmine rice, I ended up craving that fried crunch by the end of the meal. The veggies were all pretty standard, I wish they had put some seasoning on them, but thinking back, it was refreshing to have some plain veggies to compliment the big flavor of the meat.\\n\\nDrinks: We ordered two glasses of their Cabernet Sauvignon, don't remember which brand it was but it was decent enough, not super dry but still did the trick.\\n\\nService: Our waitress Kyra(sp?) was absolutely amazing! Constantly refilled our waters, checked on us periodically, gave us recommendations, and made sure we were always taken care of. Julie and Ivan (the host/owner) were super welcoming and very friendly. They talked us through a history of the restaurant before the meal and made sure to let us know what kind of concept they were going for with this restaurant, as well as the fame surrounding their award-winning chef (he's been on the food network and owns one of the top 100 restaurants in the US). They're definitely all about exposing people to the Indonesian culture which I loved.\\n\\nAmbience: Modern-Casual-Chic. I'd say proper attire is business casual here. When you walk in you quickly noticed how clean everything is and the very modern-upscale look that they were going for, while still maintaining a cultural vibe with the decorations.\\n\\nPrice: I will say I thought it was a bit too overpriced (ended up spending $100+ for two people) and perhaps could've been a bit less, but for Buckhead I wouldn't expect much, and to be fair the food was great quality as was the service.\\n\\nParking - This is virtually non-existent, so you have to valet. It was complimentary when I went (on a Saturday), but I don't know if it is on other days so I would call ahead and ask - as always though, tip your valet.\\n\\nAll in all, I'll definitely be back to try their other dishes and can't wait to see this restaurant take off! Nothing better than seeing Buckhead get more diverse."},{"name":"Itta Bena","address":"9101 International Dr, Ste 2210","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Amazing start to our Florida get away!!!

We had siroloin, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, plain chicken, beef short ribs, pork shoulder, chicken hearts, kielbasa, Brazillian sausage, and grilled pineapple. Everything was quite tasty, with some pieces better than others (expected). I did get some nice rare pieces of sirloin and short ribs with a great crusty outside: mmm. The servers were fine, they were polite and happy to oblige to what you ask for. The grilled pineapple was a surprisingly highlight of the evening-make sure you try it! The garlic bread never came out until the very end, when we were already stuffed so we did not have any. My only real complaint is the waitress seemed a bit overbooked with tables, it took literally forever to flag her down and get our check.

It's going to fit in quite well in Union Sq. A fantastic place for a date or drinks, although big group seating will likely be hard to come by. \\n\\nTheir website hasn't been updated yet but you can find their menu here (although it was slightly different when we went):\\n\\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/373140393/Celeste-Opening-Menu\\n\\n\\n// THE SPACE // \\nSo pretty! It's small -- the bar seats around 8 and there are a handful of two and four person tables in the rest of the space -- but feels big and bright. The host asked if we had reservations but I wasn't sure where to make them online. Either way, we found seating at the bar. It got crowded later in the night (Friday) and there was a waiting for open tables. \\n\\n// THE FOOD // \\nExcited to try some Peruvian dishes I've never had before here. \\n- The lomo saltado was delicious. The beef was juicy and flavorful. Came with a separate bowl of rice. \\n- The Friday special this week was fish, cooked Chinese style. A heaping helping of fish with bell peppers and potato. \\n- Mixed seafood ceviche - another large portion, pungent with lime and a pile of fish, calamari, shrimp, and the like. There's a vegan version made with artichoke! \\n- Causa de avocado and vegetables - tasted and looked like the beautiful love child of a potato salad and deviled eggs, if you're into that (I AM.)\\n\\n// THE DRINKS //\\nLoved the drink menu. They have small $4 mezcal with House juice cocktails that cater really well to my diminutive alcohol tolerance. I think they switch the cocktails around, but the one we had was with cucumber and mint. Yum. \\n\\nWe also helped ourselves to their excellent wine list. They have orange wine! Which we haven't gone across in Boston yet. Their sparkling wine (Oyster Bay) was a delicious funky wine that capped off our night beautifully. \\n\\nOverall, Celeste is a great, classy space that Union was missing.

We were told that was served in the bar and outside (perfectly normal) and that the bar was 'at capacity' (not so normal).

NO REGRETS! \\n\\nWe showed up about an hour before opening and were the first in line (yay!) but were joined within 15 minutes by about 5 others. The line steadily grew all the way up until opening. I really appreciated that the line takes place indoors and is inside a mini grocery/bodega where you can actually get coffee and/or beer while you wait. They have great local beers on tap. TIP: Order your beer BEFORE it's time to order BBQ - it is two completely separate cashiers/tabs.  \\n\\nAbout 10 mins prior to the official opening time, they started taking orders. Make sure you're ready to go/have done your research so as to not hold up the line. For two hungry people, we ordered a 1/4 lb of brisket, a 1/4 lb of pulled pork, 2 pork ribs, 1 beef rib (this ended up being the size of my forearm), and 2 chipotle sausages. We also ordered a side of potato salad and some sliced bread; ended up finishing everything except 1 chipotle sausage. \\n\\nThe brisket was to. die. for. Melt in your mouth goodness. The beef and pork ribs both fell off the bone - I usually despise pork ribs because the ones I've had before were always so dry, but these really made me see the light. The pulled pork was the only disappointment - I agree with the other reviews that it was a bit dry. Chipotle sausage was huge and juicy with a great flavorful kick. \\n\\nHands down the best BBQ I've had and neither of us felt like we missed out at all by coming here instead of Franklin's.

I've had some time off during the day, and this place is an incredible deal for their lunch special.  For around 10 bucks you get two apps, a small salad, a HUGE entr√©e, and a small drink.  This is only for lunch, they have a separate dinner special that doesn't include a drink and costs more.  Also it's a seat yourself so you don't pay tip.  Honestly they still bring you the food and drinks, so really the only thing you are missing is someone to carry your plates to the clean up counter at the end.  For a 15-20 percent savings, that is huge.\\n\\nAs for the food quality, the salad is always the same, and has a decent Asian dressing and pieces of pineapple to make it interesting.  It's not much and not fancy, but I consider it a free gift.\\n\\nThere are a lot of choices for the aps.  I think that the fried dumplings and Shumai look tempting, but the blueberry ragoons and seaweed salad are tastier choices.  As for the entree, I've been getting either the drunken noodles or pad thai.  You can also select your meat.  I think for sheer volume, the crispy chicken gets you the most mass of protein per dollar, but the shrimp adds more flavor to the noodles (the shrimp gets cooked with the noodles, while the crispy chicken is added to the top).  And for drinks I always get the thai iced tea.   \\n\\nOverall as long as their lunch deal is still going, and I think it might be over soon, this place can't be beat."},{"name":"Hops N Scotch","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"To sum it up: mediocre food and sub-par service. \\n\\nI went here for brunch with a friend and my boyfriend earlier today.

The waiter also got my boyfriend's order slightly wrong. He originally ordered wheat toast, but asked if he could have a biscuit instead. Of course the waiter didn't correct this, and the dish came with wheat toast. \\n\\nThe only quick thing about our meal?

I was really interested in what they would do with the old location and I was pretty happy to hear they would be doing Ramen and Bento.  Turns out this move is a win/win for me.  I get sushi even closer to my office, and I get good ramen closer than Tatsuya or Michi. \\n\\nOf course I mentioned those 'other' ramen places.  I'd say Hanabi is right up there with Tatsuya.  It's different for sure, but it is just as tasty, as well as a little different.  I had a Kimchi Pork Dumpling ramen and it was delicious.  Salty broth, soft boiled egg, chashu pork, kimchi, and some mini-dumplings full of pork. It was a ton of food and I am fully stuffed.  The chashu pork was definitely not as 'melt-in-you-mouth' as Tatsuya, but it had more of a char-grilled flavor, which I really enjoyed.  The mini-dumplings were also a welcome addition to any bowl of ramen.  \\n\\nI don't want this to get overly long, so I will just say that I really love the people at Hanabi.

This BBQ is top notch."},{"name":"Asaase Ital Palace","address":"1600 SW 5th and College","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"How many days has it been since Kody reviewed this cart on the 9th of July (and I got confused when I first wrote this, Petra actually nabbed the FTR, but I didn't see the listing until the 9th!)? 15 days? Ok, so I've been waiting anxiously to try the food from Asaase Ital Palace for at least 15 days, and today was finally the day. \\n\\nAs a background, I've spent a little time in the Caribbean: the Bahamas, Cayman Islands, and Caribbean Yucutan coast, and I LOVE Caribbean food. In fact, a well-made Peas and Rice ranks up there amongst my favorite dishes ever, and anything made with coconut is my friend. \\n\\nSo as I sat and read Kody's review in rapt attention, I got excited. Some of my favorite food, served via one of my favorite distribution methods (food cart)? Aw yeah. Plus, as far as I know, there's no Caribbean food in Portland at all, let alone Ital food. So the combination is an exciting one for me. Now while I do appreciate the copious amounts of fish in typical Carib fare, I am also down with the Ital style.\\n\\nI finally made a special trip down to the PSU food carts today to get irie with some peas and rice... and... no peas and rice today. :( Sadness. I quizzed the proprietor, and he said that rather than a Jamaican style peas or a Bahamian style, his peas are an African style (I have no idea what this means). I'm still looking forward to trying them. Believe me, once you've had a proper peas and rice, you'll never be the same again. \\n\\nBut how sad can I be when it's about 75 in the shade, I'm standing across the counter from someone exuding good vibrations, and some cheerful African music is playing in the background? Not sad at all. So many other amazing-looking options are displayed on the fresh menu. Red beans over rice with greens, fried plantains, palm nut soup, ground nut soup, red red, chick-un drumettes, jerk fish (fake fish), and an assortment of fresh veggie juices and smoothies? Oh yeah. \\n\\nI opted for the #3 - red beans, greens, and rice... and the guy running the stand threw in a chicken drumette for me to try. There are two sizes offered, Small ($6) and Large ($9). I opted for the large, which is a LOT to pay for beans and rice for lunch (I know how much that costs, I make a much less tasty version myself), but what looks small is actually too much for me to eat. I think the $6 portion would probably have been enough... maybe a little light. So the price is really the only thing holding this review from 5-stars.\\n\\nThe chicken drumette was tasty, with a little lemongrass \\"bone\\" in the middle. Great seasoning, and a pretty good texture (for vegan chicken). It's not so chickeny as to be \\"scary\\" for vegans, and not chickeny enough to pass for someone who eats the stuff on a regular basis, but it's still quite good on it's own. \\n\\nThe beans/greens/rice dish was REALLY good. Lots of subtle flavors in the beans and greens, served over a buttery yellow rice (also vegan, but it tasted buttery, which is awesome). So many spices involved that are a mystery to me, but so tasty. I wish I had known about the hot sauce that I'm now reading about in other reviews. I can only assume that they use the more Carib-style Scotch Bonnet peppers (Haba√±ero) rather than the American-style cayenne. The haba√±ero flavor combined with coconut and beans is one of my favorite flavor combos of all time. Those peppers carry with them an amazingly complex depth of sweetness, peppery goodness, and searing spice. It's hard to describe. \\n\\nOverall, I couldn't finish my $9 portion (which, for the price, was a good thing), but it didn't leave me with enough for a second full meal. That said, the ingredients were very high quality, and the meal left me feeling a lot healthier for having eaten it. I think a lot of the value you're going to get for the price here lies in the fact that this food is vegan and has amazing flavors, and that it's so much more whole and healthy than other cart food. \\n\\nThere are some days where I want something cheap and big. On those days, I grab a burrito or something similar, and while I'm full for less, I'm also feeling the after-burrito slump. To the contrary, today my body felt thankful after this healthier-than-normal food. Plus, where the hell else in Portland are you going to find Caribbean food... and ital food at that?!?\\n\\nI'm a total fan of this place. Based on what I had today, I'm willing to pay more than average cart prices for this stuff. I am really looking forward to trying the palm nut soup and other options.

I'm sorry I offended you by making eye contact and saying thank you.  \\n\\nWhen I brought our food back to the table I could see the tots were a mistake.   They were dark brown and looked over cooked.   We each took a bite of one and I went back up and ordered fries.   I would absolutely not recommend the bacon tots.  They were actually pretty gross.  \\n\\nAnyway, the fries we got were pretty good.  Now the burgers.   The presentation was pretty good but the taste was not there.   The patties were over cooked and overall they just turned into a big mess.

Owners do not respond to customer complaints although employees are clearly trained to be overly friendly... this location is negligent and I  refuse to spend more money here because supervisors and owners do not acknowledge wrong orders or complaints. Look into who's franchising these types of businesses!!! I won't spend $ at the new opening Beaverton location if it is the same owners.

Rosa de rosi arrives with a nice deep spice and its a perfect match to the Lamb Shank (Osso Bucco). The meat falls off the bone and although I'm not a fan of throwing veggies at a dish in a whim, the peas, carrots and zucinni would do well to add color, texture and flavour. The only suggestion is to ditch the risi bisi (rice and peas) and go with a risotto. \\n\\nThe easy reservations through OpenTable made this evening spectacular.

When I got to the restaurant I noticed that their posted menu was QUITE different from the online menu. I asked about the enchiladas and the guy behind the counter said, \\"Oh, no, sorry.\\" I think they may have gotten this question before. So I ordered chips and salsa, some tacos, and a quesadilla for my enchilada-craving friend, all to go. When the chips and salsa were ready I was surprised to see that the salsa was already drizzled all over the chips, which meant that they would be soggy by the time I got back to my bandmates.

We ordered the basil fried rice ($9), crispy pad thai ($9) and massaman curry ($13). The only downside is that rice doesn't come with the curries so you have to order that separately. The portions were very generous and the curry wasn't overly greasy at all. From what other Yelpers said, I was expecting my curry to have a thick layer of oil on top but it was really flavorful, creamy and delicious. And only $1 extra for scallops!\\n\\nBeware, the basil fried rice is quite spicy but if you welcome spice, I'd go for it. Everything was terrific for the price and we have tons of leftovers between the two of us. They also readily accepted our groupon, and were quite friendly (not overly friendly though - after all, we're dealing with Asian service!).

This was also a super generous portion and it was delicious. Just as expected!\\n\\nSpecial Burger: I unfortunately forgot the name of this burger, but it had seitan and mac n cheese! This was my first time tasting vegan mac n cheese and I was so curious about it before coming in. One bite and I knew vegan mac n cheese might be the way to go for me. The burger patty was I believe also seitan and had that soft texture. Overall it was really good, but I was full after eating half!\\n\\n\\"Meatball\\" sub: My friend ordered this meatball sub, but it was unfortunately a little underwhelming. The meatballs are also made of seitan, but when you think of meatball, you think of a chewier texture. The seitan was still very soft so it didn't really blow us out of the water. Maybe this would've been okay if we hadn't ordered all seitan, but by this point in the meal we were kind of tired of the same types of texture. \\n\\nBerry cheesecake: so so so good. Tastes just like normal cheesecake?? How did they do that??? \\n\\nOverall I'd definitely like to come back to try a full plate of their vegan mac n cheese. I like cheese, but usually mac n cheese can get really overwhelming for me since I didn't grow up eating cheese all the time. Vegan mac n cheese left me feeling less bloated so I'm extra curious to try it again! Plus, vegan desserts are really great! The seitan dishes were good, but I do wish they had cooked it a different way to make it have more variety in texture which I think would make the dishes even more awesome, but overall I'm really pleased with the presentation and the experience! :) I can imagine real vegetarians/vegans would go crazy over this place and now I have another restaurant to bring my non-meat eating friends!"},{"name":"Mamma Maria","address":"3 North Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Best Italian I have ever had.

While the exclusion of traditional seaweed is disappointing, the fresh variety of veggies is lovely, the fried egg is never runny, and the flavor is very delicate and clean.

The coffee was also delicious as you get a subtle hint of spice in the coffee and it's Soo smooth.\\n\\nOverall, definitely a place to hit and try as you Moroccan tea is something uncommon that you don't typically see."},{"name":"Hooligan's Sports Bar and Grill","address":"8220 NE Vancouver Plaza Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Went on a busy Saturday night but should still get food before 45 mins. have passed.

I chose this spot because I wanted to splurge a little as it was my first time visiting Vancouver. We started our meal with the octopus mosaic. It was probably my favorite dish of the night. It was really refreshing with just the right amount of acidity. I opted for the tagliatelle Nero and my friend got the chicken fettuccine. I really enjoyed my pasta but the shrimp tasted cheap and the lobster tail didn't taste a whole lot better either which was disappointing. My friend liked his dish but I personally felt it was a little too rich for me. Apart from the less than fresh seafood, I had a good dining experience here and would come back again if I'm ever in BC. I don't mind paying a little more for food and am always down for a finer dining experience but they could definitely step it up with the grade of seafood that is being served. It's subpar to other restaurants that charge similar prices.

This place rates somewhere between four and five stars for me. The pizza here is legit. The gluten-free dough tastes just as good as, if not better than, the regular dough. It's pretty amazing.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this review, there are two locations open in Atlanta: this one, the original, which opened in January 2018 and the Toco Hills location which opened in April 2018. At least two more locations are planned: Sandy Springs and Reynoldstown, opening in 2019. This location can be found at the Brickworks, in the same building that houses 5 Seasons Brewing. The Local Pizzaiolo is in the space formerly occupied by Bellwoods. I liked Bellwoods, but this place is better.\\n\\nThere's free parking at the Brickworks in multiple lots including a rooftop deck.\\n\\nI was first introduced to The Local Pizzaiolo at a Yelp event at the business' Toco Hills location in July 2018 (https://www.yelp.com/biz/cye-yelps-taste-of-the-local-pizzaiolo-toco-hill-atlanta). There, I got to sample many of the restaurant's pizzas which I thought were quite good. It inspired me to check out this location in Westside which is close to where I live. Pizzaiolo is pronounced \\"pizza yo-lo.\\" The \\"iolo\\" part of the name stands for \\"I Only Live Once.\\"\\n\\nUnlike the Toco Hills location which has a tiny patio and a suburban chain look, this Westside location is more hip. It's got a spacious, industrial, loft-like interior with tall, exposed ceilings, lots of windows, fun European-inspired wall art, and a large, wraparound, covered patio. There's an open pizza prep kitchen with a Marra Forni oven. Just inside the entrance is a small market stocked with various pizza-making ingredients (some of the same stuff they use in the kitchen), different olive oils and vinegars, tableware, books, apparel, and more.\\n\\nThis is a fast-casual restaurant where you order at the counter upfront and the food is brought to you. Fountain drinks, tea, and pizza boxes for leftovers are self-serve. Old tomato cans at the tables store napkins, forks, and knives.\\n\\nThe menu is straightforward. They offer a few salads, priced at $7-8 each, and over a dozen pizzas, priced at $9-15 each. The pizzas are personal size (11 inches) and cut into four slices each. You can't create your own pizza, but you can customize what's already on the menu (we did that with one of the pizzas we ordered). Every pizza is available gluten-free for $2 extra. Finally, there are also desserts ($4-5 each) like gelato (you can see the flavors in the freezer by the counter) and Nutella bites, espresso and espresso-based drinks ($2.50-4.50), and cocktails ($9), beer and wine ($6-7).\\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\n\\n* Margherita ($9) - crushed Italian San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, olive oil, Grana Padano Parmesan\\n* The Gypsy ($12) - herb-roasted wild mushroom, fresh mozzarella, aged provolone, fresh parsley, bechamel sauce, truffle oil plus prosciutto (add-on) and gluten-free dough (+$2)\\n* The Local ($15) - fresh mozzarella, aged provolone, Heirloom Market BBQ beef brisket, and cipollini onions drizzled with smoked hot honey\\n\\nThe pizzas were delicious. In general, I thought they were tastier than the pizzas I tried at the Toco Hills location (and those were already good). I think Antico and Varuni Napoli still have the best Margherita pizzas in town, but The Local Pizzaiolo's version isn't bad.\\n\\nWhat really impressed me were The Gypsy and The Local. The flavors were incredible - very rich and delectable. Just about every bite was amazing. The ingredients were fresh and high quality. I was blown away by the gluten-free crust that we had ordered on The Gypsy. I don't typically eat gluten-free. That said, this gluten-free dough was unlike any other gluten-free dough I've eaten. It was great in terms of both taste and texture. The dough was soft (softer, in my opinion, than the regular dough) and appetizingly chewy. I learned that The Local Pizzaiolo's gluten-free dough is made out of rice and tapioca. The recipe, of course, is secret. I highly recommend trying out one of the pizzas with their gluten-free dough. I think you might be just as surprised as I was.\\n\\nWhat I like about The Local is it features brisket from one of Atlanta's best BBQ restaurants, Heirloom Market BBQ. I think that's pretty neat. The Local Pizzaiolo doesn't skimp on the portions (so far, I've had this pizza twice - once here and once at Toco Hills). The combination of ingredients works well. The smoked hot honey is icing on top of the cake. If you order this pizza, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nAnother recommendation I have, which I had at the Toco Hills location, is the Montanara ($10). It's made with flash-fried dough, Ciliegino tomato sauce, fresh mozarella and basil, and Grana Padano Parmesan.\\n\\nService was excellent. Ernest is wonderful.\\n\\nThere's free Wi-Fi.

It was an absolute waste of time and money. There was two of us and as soon as we enter the door we saw other people waiting at the host stand to be sat, we waited for 10 minutes and no host came around to see anybody so we decided to sit at the bar just because we wanted a quick breakfast. We weren't greeted for another 10 minutes and sat waiting as other patrons were being taken care of, we felt as though we were being judged by the bartenders because we were minorities dining here. Both of us work in the restaurant industry And understand what it is like to be understaffed but the customer service was not there at all. Once we were finally greeted, we were missing drinks and there were only two of us. I requested to have the all American breakfast but instead of potatoes, toast. Very simple. And the bartender told me that they couldn't do it and that I was making things complicated. So I said it's fine and I took the potatoes anyways. But it was extremely rude and it made me feel as though I was asking for something out of the ordinary. Once my food arrived, we still didn't have our drinks, no water, No silverware. It was all an absolute mess. Nobody asked us how our food came out or if we wanted any napkins, we had to wave down the bartenders who would constantly avoid us. It was extremely rude and made us feel as though we were different from the other customers. I requested to speak to a manager to which the bartender told me that the manager was too busy to come talk to me.

One of my favorite restaurants here in Austin. \\n\\nOn the happy hour menu, I would strongly recommend the Blanche.

Another favorite is the Curly Tail, but I don't think it's on the HH menu anymore.\\n\\nEverything on this menu is good - you really can't go wrong. Us vegetarians have a smaller selection, but the staff is great and they're always willing to make substitutions. Additionally, the menu does have several amazing options. Try the brussels sprouts and the roasted organic beets. The cauliflower and wild rice casserole is also delicious. \\n\\nWhatever you do though, make sure that you try the Bananas Foster Beignets. It may be the best desert in Austin, and that is coming from someone who doesn't even like bananas.

Anyways, so this is what I was describing to my fellow peers... I asked the waiter if they had puri and he said YES! So I had an order for them and couldn't wait to pop one in my mouth (*drooling uncontrollable at this point). \\n\\nWhen the waiter brought out a plate, I was taken aback from the girth of this pastry. What the heck is it??? It's Poori the guy said. You mean it's not pani puri??? No, it's poori. Obviously there's a difference and by pronouncing it, heck if I knew. One of my peer asked how I was going to stuff this in my mouth all in one bite?? LOL \\n\\nOk, come to find out, poori is a deep fried bread very similar to pani puri but much bigger and served with potato curry etc... and mostly eaten for breakfast... Regardless, anything fried is good. I did enjoy it and had asked for a side of tamarind chutney so I could dip it. Very tasty.\\n\\nThe lunch menu has plenty of curry and vegetable dishes.

And let me tell you: the salad portions they give you are enough for a whole meal on its own too.  So if you opt for that, you're seriously getting almost 2 meals here.  I work right down the street, so I often opt for that:  gyro for the day; salad for tomorrow's lunch waiting for me in the breakroom fridge.\\n\\nWhen you order the gyro, they cut the meat off the spit right in front of you and I kid you not:  when you watch them do it, you're wondering if it's all for you, the ample amount they're slicing.

It's located in the North End so it's definitely limited in seating. Get reservations if you can. \\n\\nWe came with a party of 6 during lunch and were sat in the front. Thankfully the patio window was open or else we wouldn't be able to get into our seats! If you are sat in the front, the tables are situated very close together that the back of your seat is going to be touching the back of the person sitting behind you. \\n\\nWe got quite a few things. The Gnocchi, carbonara, spaghetti with clams, crazy alfredo, meatball appetizer, fried calamari, and eggplant appetizer. Unfortunately, nothing really wowed us except the crazy alfredo. I would come back just for this dish. I've never seen it anywhere else and it was by far the best tasting. When reading the reviews, everyone said get the gnocchi. So we did. It seems like they bake the gnocchi so when you use your fork to stab it, it'll become mushy. It begins to clump with the other gnocchi and the next thing you know you have a plate of mashed potatoes. The carbonara says it's made the real way on the menu. I guess I'm not a fan of the real way. Oh, the free bread was pretty amazing. Super fresh with a semi hard outside and super soft inside. \\n\\nIt also took a long time to get our entrees after we had finished our appetizers.

I went in on a Saturday morning around 9:00am and we were the second people in line. To be honest, people really didn't start showing up until around 10:30, so you don't necessarily need to get there much earlier than that to be one of the first people in line. The food itself I felt was good in some areas, but fell flat in others. Their ribs are up there with the best. They're perfectly tender and coated with a sweet and spicy sauce that takes them to a whole other level. The house made pickles are just as good. They have a unique somewhat spicy kick, but yet provide just the right amount of acidic balance to the meat. The brisket, beef rib, and Mac and cheese were not quite as good. The beef rib and brisket were kind of dry and seemed either not as fresh or over cooked. The Mac was good, but the cheese sauce was almost too thick, creating an overly heavy feeling after a few bites.

Just a small thing, but an amuse bouche!  This was followed by a wonderful beat salad with Salt Spring Island goats cheese.  Simple, but perfectly prepared and delicious.  After that, we had a duck confit plate.  Good portion again.  Nice big chunk of duck confit with pickled onion and some other bits.  Time for the main?  Nope.  One more starter.  This was a mushroom risotto which was divine.  \\n\\nNow finally the main.  I had a rare tuna with chorizo and broth with mussels.  It was outstanding.

They weren't the most comfortable, but not that big a deal compared to all the positives.\\n\\nOnly other thing to mention is that the set menu is quite different each night.  I love that.  I saw someone order a steak frite which looked amazing too.  Huge pile of shoestring fries and a good size chunk of steak.\\n\\nOh yeah, forgot to mention the dessert.  It was simple, but delicious.

I called to place a take out order. After requesting an item that is listed on their menu online I was told that they don't make that item. Ooookkkayyyy, but it's on YOUR menu on YOUR website. They had no idea it was listed on their website. I moved on. When I went to pick up my food I noticed that the ~$2.00 broccoli that I ordered as part of my pasta dish wasn't cooked in the dish but just placed on top of the rest of the dish. This was puzzling to me as 1. Their website didn't say \\"these items are not cooked in the sauce that your dish is made in and are just a garnish(?)\\" which to me, is a pretty big point to leave out (but then again, these people have no idea what is/isn't on their website so I guess that makes sense that I shouldn't have gone by the website, silly me) and 2. I've never been to an Italian restaurant that doesn't cook all of the ingredients of your meal together. I mean, that's what makes it a dish, right? Anyway when I inquired about the broccoli the guy said that they \\"don't have the capability to saut√© the vegetables that you order in your dish in the sauce.\\" HUH?? That's really funny though because the \\"about\\" section on yelp literally says \\"saut√©ed vegetables\\" as part of the ingredients.  He immediately offered to refund me for the food and said they wouldn't be offended if I didn't want it. Um, your feelings are not of my concern whatsoever. You being offended is irrelevant. You have a crazy business and I'm glad I found out the level of your insanity before it was too late. What a mess. Based on the other negative reviews, if the owner decides to write back and reiterate what happened, it's irrelevant. You need to work on better communications on your website so people aren't surprised by your off-kilter practices, bottom line.

Perfectly fried pieces of chicken, minimal breading and packed with a slightly spicy tang. If you're used to ordering orange chicken or some other shenanigans, get this to start venturing out. \\n2. XLBs - 4/5 more soup inside than DTF, larger and cheaper. The dough is thicker on all of their dim sum, and in this instance, it does a great job of preventing the insides from leaking out. \\n3. Beef chow mein  - 5/5 not greasy, chalk full of flavor. It's the wife's favorite chow mein she's had. The noodles are slightly al dente, and the sauce has just the right amount of soy sauce without being overbearing. \\n4. Veggie dishes - 5/5. The first time I came was with my Chinese coworker. I don't know what she ordered for the table, but it was good. I think it was pea shoots and they've got a plethora of garlic - enough to ward off vampires for several hours. \\n\\nAll in all, it's a great spot.

The servers are friendly and welcoming, they make you feel like you've visited old friends who are cooking you dinner. You do need a reservation as there are so few tables that they fill up for the night quickly. My partner took me here for my birthday, the server brought out complimentary champagne at the end of our delectable meal which was the cherry on top a delicious meal of pasta and the stuffed pork rib chop. Suffice to say we were STUFFED. It was one of the servers birthdays so the whole restaurant sang her happy birthday and a cake was brought out, the whole restaurant was offered cake which again added to the family atmosphere.

Cocktails are $2 off and there's a good chunk of food items for $5. We ordered truffled deviled eggs, chicken liver mousse, brussels sprout leaves, duck fat fries, and honey rosemary dipped fried chicken off the happy hour menu and the cracklin skin duroc pork belly off the specials for the day. The happy hour items can fill you up so probably not necessary to order off the menu unless there's something you are dying to try. I liked how the fried chicken was boneless and that they give you plenty of toast for the chicken liver mousse. The only con was the pork belly skin being too salty but the meat itself was fine.

I'm not even kidding every time I go in I feel as if I am having to walk on eggshells to not upset a worker that's clearly always upset. It's not one employee it's several who have made the experience less than satisfactory. I feel bad for\\nThe owner because I'm sure he wouldn't like to hear how his employees make the customers feel. Today my boyfriend went in to order us food to go. He sake no mustard on my sandwich which there wasn't just mustard there was piles of it. That's fine I get a mistake....but that's not why I'm mad. Today was the last straw. The new employee was a female who asked for my boyfriend's name, he said nick but she heard rick. So when the man who finished my boyfriend's philly sandwich calls \\"rick\\" he doesn't answer because that's not his name.....he didn't know the woman heard him wrong. After the gig employee continues to yell rick...nick finally says is that a philly? Tells him his name is nick and he's sorry well employee clearly is mad ( as if my boyfriend caused this simple mistake???) so he hands my boyfriend (throws into his hand aggressively and rude) his sandwich to him. Seems not a big deal but I am just so done with the disrespectful rude people. Maybe y'all will read this and realize."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I don't even know where to begin.

So I thought, this place must be absolutely amazing, right? Wrong.\\n\\nI was really disappointed.  At first bite into the carrot cake, the cream on top was sweet and light, overall unique and pretty good, but as I tried the rest of the cake, it was quite bland, somewhat dry, and overall not tasteful at all.  The chocolate pieces that I tried was good, but I just didn't think it was worth the $1.50 and it was just too small.

Our planned choice was closed so we decided to follow somebody who we both agreed \\"looked like he was on his way to brunch somewhere.\\" After a few blocks our inferior sleuthing abilities were quickly realized and we lost the trail. As we stood on the corner wondering what to do next, we turned and saw Two Chefs and a Table. It was open. Having no other real options and seeing as we were cold and hungry, we happily went inside. The decision turned out to be a good one. After perusing the menu and agreeing that everything sounded superb, I settled on the classic Benedict while my accomplice chose the hash (the name of which we now forget.) Both choices were great. Fresh ingredients, prepared right and with plenty of flavor. The toast and cinnamon-pear spread that came with the hash was awesome. Great coffee brought to the table in a French press. And to top it all off the price was totally reasonable.

We were not impressed and did not return until last week, again for lunch. Mathew Odam had just touted it as his number 19 Austin restaurant. He obviously didn't eat there with us. \\n\\nWe ordered some fried plantains as a first course to share. I have eaten fried plantains in Venezuela, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and in the USA. I have Puerto Rican friends who made them for me. I have never had such a oily, soggy mess served to me before. It was painfully clear that they were not actually fried, but poached in oil that was not hot enough actually fry the food. If you pressed on one of the squishy, gummy plantain slices, oil flowed forth as if from a sponge. We complained and the waitress took them back to the kitchen. We intended just to have them removed from our bill, but a few minutes later she returned with the plate of the same plantains as before, having just received another oil bath. It was just gross. When I complained that they were just as greasy as before, she got defensive, testy and started arguing with me explaining that it was not grease, it was corn oil and that when you cook the plantains, you actually submerge them in the oil, that's how it is done. I was so dumbfounded with such a stupid and inane description of frying that I decided just to let it go. I have been making deep fried things since before she was born.\\n\\nMy wife's shrimp and mushrooms was pretty good. But it was made with their own pre-made, jarred sauce that they sell. My duck enchiladas in mole sauce was OK, but certainly not on a par with the same dish at El Alma or Licha's. I got three generous enchiladas in mole sauce and nothing else on the plate. I would have preferred two with something else, like grilled vegetables or rice. The mole sauce was somewhat one dimensional and lacked the sophistication of well made and more complex moles.

I would have also they rather just use a blood orange peel than soaking an entire wedge in the glass which takes away from the minimal and simplified intentions of a classic old fashioned.

It came on 4 small dishes, on top of this \\"stand\\". I think a small tower would work better, as the stand had arms that reached a bit too far.\\n\\nRoasted beet and goat cheese salad ($10): this was a very good portion. Lots of beet pieces that surround an arugula salad, topped with a balsamic vinaigrette. \\n\\nCrab and shrimp avocado salad ($12): this was presented in a tower, with avocado on the bottom and shrimp on the top. The avocado had some unknown hard bits in it. Crab and shrimp mixture was good.\\n\\nSablefish ($29): this was recommended by the waitress, and I am so glad that I ordered it. The fish was melt in your mouth and perfectly seasoned with miso. It was a generous portion, too. It came on top of a bok choy and green/red pepper mix. The bok choy was delicious.

There are peanuts around it, and you pour a warm ganache over the chocolate that melts and exposes the mousse. So fun and impressive, but wait! It also tastes AMAZING. The mousse mixes with the peanuts for a chocolatey peanut buttery taste. I would come back again just for this!\\n\\nMason jar creation ($9): they have a limited number of these every night. That night it was tiramisu. The flavours were all good and what I would expect for a tiramisu. Creamy custard and soaked ladyfingers on the bottom. Although very good, it could not compare to the chocolate bomb.\\n\\nFor a special occasion, we'll definitely be back. I also plan to bring my aunt here when she comes to visit.

The waiters were all very pleasant, and the pasta was absolutely delicious to say the least. \\n\\nI ordered the taglierini, which is a thin spaghetti-like pasta with wild mushroom, pinot grigio chiles and olive oil. This entree seemed very ordinary but the taste was fresh and full of flavor. Being a pasta maker myself, I definitely can tell the quality and freshness of the dough, and Lupo was on point with their pasta entrees. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the grand marnier creme br√ªl√©e as well as the chocolate torte with hazelnut and blood orange sorbet.

It was even a place i HAD to go to when i came back to visit Austin during  a short stint of living on the east coast.  I'm not kidding.  i LOVED Amaya's and their puffy tacos.\\n\\nI had been with the bf to Amaya's before they moved.  I had to teach him about puffy tacos!  Then i noticed that they had moved to a bigger building across the highway.  I was happy for them!  They deserved it!  It was always so packed in that little shopping center location!  It will be soooo awesome to go to a bigger place!\\n\\nNot so much.  Everything has changed now that they are in the new space.\\n\\nThe BF and i came in at about 4 pm on a Sunday.  Not a busy time.   It was only half full when we got there.  So, we stroll in and there is no one at the hostess station.  It's cool, we'll wait.  Finally a busboy showed up and asked if we wanted to sit at the bar.. ?   No, we want to sit at a table.  He says:  Ok, someone will be here in a few minutes.   Huh?  soooo?  wait.  there is no hostess to sit us at a table?  you can sit us at the bar but not a table?  Ooookkay.  Whateves.  It's cool.  Again.  We'll wait a few more minutes.

Then we sit... we look at the menus... we wait... we make our choices... we're still waiting.  NO ONE shows up.  No one.

He takes our drink orders (we got top shelf margarita's, rocks for me & frozen for the BF) and promises that a waitress will be right over.  She showed up a few minutes later.  Which, seriously, at this point... Yeah.  It's Not okay anymore.  i was clearly pissed and gave that vibe to the manager.  He should have sent someone running over.   Annnnyways, we order.  Order comes.  It is wrong.  I ordered a chicken taco, they give me beef.  I was just going to eat it (because, why bother... no one is going to check on us)  but the gracious BF flagged down the waitress and told her my taco was wrong.  I will say that they did  quickly replace the taco (the only quick thing that happened in the visit.)  \\n\\nThe food.  it was Meh.  My taco was good, the BF was disappointed by his enchilada, tho, he said the 2nd one was better than the first.  /shrug.   The rice was tasteless and seriously, the whole experience was so bad...  Nothing could fix it.  I'm big on service.  I've said it before:  This is Austin.  We can throw a stone and hit 5 places with amazing Tex-Mex.

The man who had prepared them in the box must have somehow flipped the box over at some point, because I was carrying the box of cupcakes like it was a child. I take cupcakes very seriously and would never do anything to disrupt the appearance of beautiful cupcakes. Also--most bakeries have boxes with holsters in them for each cupcake so this exact situation doesn't happen. If you're going to charge high prices for cupcakes, part of that price should be to ensure that your cupcakes are placed correctly in the box and not flipped over when you excitedly open the cupcake box. I gave one extra star because the cupcakes I was able to try tasted delightful."},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The food here was delicious, but I was most pleased with the staff.

My brisket sandwich could have been shared between 2 or 3 adults. And it was piled high with stuff - so much so it lost the flavor of the brisket, which frankly was pretty darn good plain. I had a similar problem with the burger - too much stuff to meat ratio so you lose the flavor of the meat. Both become just a huge mess, like when kids color  with 1/2 dozen color in the same area.

I have been to some downtown, all over southeast and a couple in northeast.  All different kinds of food.\\nI wanted to try the chez dodo cart because the lamb curry picture in front of the cart and on the yelp website, looked very appetizing.  That is NOT the lamb that you will be served.  My friend and I were explicitly told that no the lamb in the pictures is not the same because he is serving \\"street food\\", he pointed to the picture, laughs and says \\"if I served lamb like that it would be a sit down restaurant and cost a lot more, this is street food at street food prices\\".  I should have asked for a refund.  I ate a little bit because it was $9 and I was hungry I left the rest for homeless people downtown, I feel bad for leaving the essentially dog food.\\nEverything I didn't like about it.\\n1. The pictures shows beautiful pieces of lamb.  You get shredded lamb that is not seasoned well and MUSH.  Think dog food or bad baby food-kinda baby you don't love .\\n2. The vegetables are obviously frozen. Mushy and no taste.  It's sooooo obviously a frozen pack because all veggies are uniformly cut--as in done by a machine not fresh that morning.  $9=fresh cut veggies if not less meat and smaller portions, no shortcuts please.  If he was charging $3 for the meal I would say he was good soul for providing low cost food.  I would never recommend this place.  If all places were closed downtown and this was the only open restaurant I would see how hungry you were, if possible I would get you candy bar from rite aid until we could get you real food.  Mc Donald's might be disgusting but at least it taste good and is not $9 for lunch.\\nI really hope this cart simplifies the menu. Just be good at one thing. No special, no big poster, just one thing.\\n\\nNice people working behind the counter , especially young man. Chez became very, very, very defensive and passive aggressive when I pointed out that my lamb looked nothing like the picture.  Young man tried to reassure me but you could tell he was EMBARRASSED! By his reaction, he gets asked the question all the time.  And I'm pretty sure his boss, Chez EVERYTIME tries to deflect. The Egyptian pharaoh place on the corner is WAY better tasting and less expensive. The guy working there is super nice.  The food cart business is great for those who can cook.  If all your good at is marketing and getting people to like you--eventually people will find someone else more likable who can actually cook.\\n\\nIt would be nice if chez could allow someone else to do the cooking and menu.  My guess is that young man probably has a WAY better beat on what portlander's want.  Chez seems good at networking and marketing.  Need an actual chef, not someone hoping to be. Total disaster.

I moved to Beacon Hill from Manhattan a year and a half ago and Bin 26 was the first neighborhood restaurant I walked into, after finding that there were no bar/counter seats a few doors down at Figs.  \\n\\nWhile Figs has since added a very nice little bar for people who want to pop in for a quick drink and a decent pizza...Bin 26 has completely slid over the course of my three visits (the final visit being somewhat against my will).  On my first visit, I sat at the bar, had some oysters and the hanger steak, which came with a nice crispy potato gratin.  It was cooked rare as requested with a nice char on the outside.  By the second visit however, this straighforward dish inexplicably appeared as an overcooked and tasteless piece of meat (picture cooking a steak in a pan to the right doneness, slicing it before it had rested, then doing something like spritzing it with hotdog water and microwaving for a minute...that's the only way I can imagine this dish was finished), all accompanied by bland roasted tomatoes.  I was in a group of 4 and there were a few other things that looked good (squash risotto was decent), but the best plates were the ones that didn't really require any cooking (anchovies, salumi selection).  \\n\\nBy my final visit, I may have been more attuned to the mediocrity, and at times outright poorly done, plates because of the long wait.  We showed with a party of 6 on a Thursday night around 7:30 without a reservation.  We were definitely prepared to wait but since we were looking to go out for drinks and then dinner, we figured we would combine the two and just have drinks in the bar area while waiting.  The initial quote of 45 minutes turned into nearly an hour and 45 but there was just no information coming from the bar and we didn't want to walk away from time invested and start looking for another restaurant after an hour and a half and two bottles of wine.  \\n\\nOverall despite all the pronouncements of \\"Ars.

But Local No 7 was a short walk away so we decided to check them out. Seems like your typical sports bar with some good ole' American bar food.\\n\\nIt was bustling on a Sunday afternoon - there was a Falcons game and a Atlanta United game, so every TV had something playing. Our server was hard to flag down but when he WAS around he was super friendly and helpful. \\n\\nWe ordered the chili, which according to the menu was award winning. We also decided to try the steak and fries, which also came highly recommended by our server (over the fish and chips). The chili was pretty tasty, especially with all that cheese. The steak was cooked well, but the chimichurri was a bit thick and chunky and weird to me but the taste was fine. Fries and greens were average. \\n\\nOverall, Local No 7 is not bad. It just seems like your typical bar with good ole American food.

They had a huge deck as well as ample inside seating for waiting. That, I love. There's nothing I despise more than a restaurant that always has a wait, but doesn't have ample places to wait. A+ on that! I will say that the parking lot was jammed full.

I guess they have a very efficient kitchen and kudos for that as well!\\n\\nI had the two taco plate - one with beef and one with chicken. Everything was very fresh, and each section was heaping, from rice to beans, to lettuce, to tomatoes - it was great! The chicken was a bit dry, and I would have definitely liked to have tasted more seasoning but it was still decent. The beef was also good, but needed more seasoning. The one thing that I think is massively important to mention here, is that Amaya's does fresh corn tortillas, and fries them to make fresh crispy tacos. I was a little perplexed at first, as it is so different than what I'm used to. The best description I can give is that they are crispy, but slightly soft in the middle. I liked the shells, and I liked the effort. \\n\\nAll in all, this was a great experience and I'd definitely come back here to try different things.

Food is yummy- don't go expecting authentic flavors- they like to play with their dishes and make it their own.  Their ramen is yummy but not like traditional Japanese places.  Their pad Thai tastes great but not like a Thai restaurants.  Their pho is satisfactory but not like pho Viet.  So basically they offer a pan Asian menu with everything that taste great but done their way.  Very nice family owned also!"},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"44 10th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Worst experience with any pizza delivery company.  Ordered online, received a quote of 90 minutes; and thought that seemed like a long wait for Domino's, about the same as a Pizza Hut.  Well two hours later and no pizza, call or notification I called the store and they said they knew the online quotes are inaccurate; and it would be 3 - 4 hours for delivery.  Are you kidding me? 4 hours for a delivery of a domino's pizza - isn't this the company that used to guarantee 30 minute delivery?   Domino's just lost a customer forever - never again, going to bed angry and hungry!"},{"name":"Petunia's Pies & Pastries","address":"610 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Good vegan & gluten free pies but quite expensive and few choices. Overall average taste and service = 4 stars. \\n\\nPetunia's is a cute, conveniently located pie shop (especially when I was craving pie!). I wandered in with a friend and we had 3 options (raspberry rhubarb, sour cherry & peach, and blackberry rhubarb). We elected the blackberry and got a generous slice, enough for the 2 of us to happily share. The slice was $8 which is pretty pricey, even for gf & vegan.\\n\\nWe found the crust to be too hard, but enjoyed the crumble topping . The filling wasn't too sweet which was appreciated, but also the fruit flavors were not that apparent :( The pie was good for gf and vegan but otherwise I'd say it was just okay. Maybe trying a slice earlier in the day (not at evening) would be yummier."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This meal was fantastic.

The ambiance was great along with the amazing service. However, I was let down by the quality of the food. \\n\\nFor starters, we had the Kaarage (the fried chicken), which was recommended to us by our waiter. The chicken lacked soo much flavor and the wasabi sauce that came with the dish did not help to add any taste at all other than add a weird nasal burn.\\n\\nI ordered the Spicy Chasu ramen and was very underwhelmed by the lack of depth and richness in the broth. The sliced chasu pork that came with the ramen was hard and flavorless. Properly made chasu is supposed to turn out tender, rich and soft.\\n\\nIt's not the worst ramen I've had, but I don't think I'll be making a second visit."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I walked in at 4:30 and sat at the \\"bar\\", just so we could get in!

Perhaps I visited on a off day because it seems like people love it but my experience was poor. \\n\\nI ordered the egg and cheese with tofu eggs. I was really displeased with the presentation. The sandwich was a hot mess. The tofu-scramble was neon. It was really off putting. I understand that in a typical tofu scramble turmeric or mustard seed is added for color and taste. These tofu-eggs tasted like (and looked like) the entire bottle of turmeric was added. It was bad. \\n\\nThe potatoes were tasty, but the whole experience was really greasy. I guess that was partially expected because it is a \\"diner\\" vibe. However, I think they could have done better.  I'd like to return for lunch to see what these desserts are all about because they did look amazing. \\n\\nI really wanted to love this place - I think I'll try again for lunch but I won't be ordering a tofu-scramble from here ever again."},{"name":"Petunia's Pies & Pastries","address":"610 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Service is good. More vegan options is always good. The slice I got was not good. I'm not sure it's made the day I got it or even the day before. The taste and texture is not nice and frosting is overly sweet. For some reason the cake layers were really uneven and messed up, so massive amounts of frosting was used to try and cover up the uneven cake. So there are super thin parts with just huge amounts of overly sweet frosting. I expected more from an 8 dollar slice of cake."},{"name":"Jade Sushi & New Asian","address":"2425 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Visited Jade recently and now I can't wait for my next return.

And the older woman with blonde hair who's been there for a while likes to stick her stained gloves in peoples food to eat and handling money in between touching more food. My bf had to wipe his credit card with a napkin because she's cross contaminating so badly. Absolutely unacceptable. Changing and WEARING your gloves is common sense.

We were led to a tiny room upstairs with a single table inside that overlooked Paul Revere's house. Since my dad has trouble hearing this was absolutely the perfect atmosphere conducive to great conversation. \\n\\nTo start we ordered a round of Harvest Salads for the table which came with baby red spinach mix, sliced pear, toasted almonds, fresh tarragon and goat cheese. We also enjoyed a basket of complimentary bread that came with some house made pesto and olives that totally hit the spot.\\n\\nTo eat, we ordered a variety of dishes including the Halibut (absolutely DELICIOUS and not to be missed!), the Chicken, Osso Buco (tremendous) and the Frutti di Mare Pasta. We all raved about our dishes and found the portion sizes to be absolutely perfect. \\n\\nTo end the night we enjoyed a complimentary Tiramisu with a birthday candle.

There were also fried peppers in it which packed a nice kick. They had a sauce on it which had a nice spice. I don't like spicy food and the calamari had the perfect touch of heat. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the crazy Alfredo and I had the 4 mushroom rigatoni. These were two of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. You could tell the pasta was homemade and fresh. The crazy Alfredo was SO GOOD. The crazy Alfredo has a kick to it but it's tolerable.

Then the fries....if you like sweet potato fries...the Hot Honey and Sage is one to slap your mama! It was delicious. Best sweet potato fries I ever had. \\nWe also had the Bananas Foster shake with spiced rum added to it. Keep it mind you can only add the rum to the regular size and the regular is HUGE!

Right up the street we saw Carmelina's, with an open front and good smells wafting from within. I would agree that the service was slow at first,but a younger waitress picked up a lot of slack. Kudos to her. We got there at 3:00 with no reservation, and no problems. The wall bench was comfortable and the wine selection was interesting and  had informative descriptions. For example, I did not order the red wine with a \\"hint of tobacco\\" taste.\\n\\nThe menu was diverse and there were families with children dining there despite not having a kid's menu. I ordered the swordfish Catch of the day (vs.sea bass) with the pistachio blood orange saffron topping. It came over a bed of saut√©ed veggies including mini Brussels sprouts and thinly sliced potatoes that are on nobody else's menu.  Finding gems like this is why we eat out people! My mom enjoyed her clams and ate every one, which I have never seen her do. The bread at the beginning? Yummy warm and buttery crust. Perfect. \\n\\nWhile we waited for our food, we noticed that clean dishes were being placed at the bar area where dirty ones were being stacked,and there was always a stack.

Food came out at a good time. Not to slow and not to fast. I posted photos of what we ordered. Their main issue is flavoring. Maybe they are playing it conservative because they are just newly opened but they need to step it up. The beef taco's meat was too lightly seasoned. The seasoning packs you get at the grocery stores do a job 10x better! The chicken was clearly not seasoned because it have the pale white color similar to when you make chicken beast at home in the oven and put nothing on it.

Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious. Astounding? No. But very good. Definitely above average. The problems my friends and I had stemmed from the service.\\n\\nMy buddies and I made a reservation for three at 7PM on a Wednesday night. None of us had been before but found the restaurant quickly and, once seated, gushed about the tucked away coziness. The restaurant had a small crowd but wasn't packed in the least. So far so good.\\n\\nOur waitress greeted us, gave a few recommendations and left us to mull over the menu for about five minutes. As we perused the menu we commented on the interesting selections. We were excited to dive in. When our waitress returned we had our minds made up: one friend ordered sausage entree and a glass of red wine while my other friend and I both ordered warm starters and sides. She got clams and semolina gnocchi and I got the duck leg confit and semolina gnocchi. We both made sure to note that we wanted the warm starters and sides to come out at the same time. We also decided that we would split the dessert tasting to finish off the meal. Great idea right?\\n\\nThis is where the problems started. No more than ten minutes after placing my order the hostess comes out of the kitchen with my duck leg confit. I'm sure she noticed the confused look on my face but she never bothered to ask why. I wondered if someone else had ordered this at another table and if it was given to me by mistake. Even worse, I considered that maybe it was a reject from another customer and that it was presented to me to prevent food waste. Maybe they just had really fast cooks? I went over these different scenarios in my head but ultimately chose not to say anything. I was sure that the entrees for my other friends would be coming out shortly so I waited to eat. And waited and waited. \\n\\nNext thing I know there's bread on the table. Now I'm really scratching my head.  1. The bread came out super late. Since it was our first time at the restaurant we didn't know they provided bread. Had we known, we would have asked for it when it wasn't on the table within a few minutes of ordering but you don't know what you don't know. 2. My starter came out before the bread. Where they do that at? The bread was delicious and a welcome addition but come on. 3. Where was the rest of the food?!\\n\\nBy the time entrees finally came out a good 45 minutes later, my friend had only a sip of wine left and I had finished my duck leg confit because I didn't want the duck to get cold and the greens that it was resting on to get soggy. Like I said the food was very good but by then I was really angry.\\n\\nWhen they finally set entrees in front of us we were very disheartened to discover that every single order was wrong. The friend who ordered sausage was presented with a pork chop. As for my friend who ordered the clams and myself, we both had the oxtail ragu set in front of us. When we explained how wrong this was the servers just looked at each other, annoyed like it was our fault and went back to the kitchens with the food. The host (and possibly manager) gave a half-hearted apology and said we could keep an oxtail ragu at the table for the inconvenience. That would have been a nice gesture if I ate oxtail. My friends ate the food as I fumed and waited for the rest of my order to come out.\\n\\nFinally, around 8:20 everyone had what they ordered. My friends enjoyed their sausage and clams. The semolina gnocchi, like the duck, was very good but it couldn't make up for the inconvenience. What should have been a fine dining experience was a big old mess. Ultimately we nixed the dessert idea and got ice cream in downtown Decatur instead. Probably a good idea since, with the way things were going, we'd probably be presented with the wrong thing anyway.\\n\\nI'm hesitant to return to Floataway and even more hesitant to recommend it to others. Had the service been better this would have been a four or maybe five star experience. However, one mistake is passing, two are problematic, and three, in my opinion, are unacceptable. Proceed with caution, friends."},{"name":"Hunan House Chinese Restaurant","address":"2350 E Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Okay I'll start out with the food is fresh, it taste good and the staff is pretty friendly. \\nDefinitely try the sesame chicken. \\n\\nI've been to the Hunan House before but that was prior to exploring the majority of Asian restaurants in the city here.

Throughout this time, I've sat at the bar each time.  From the beginning, the service has been very inconsistent and the food has been lackluster. But I let it slide because it was so close.\\n\\nHowever, after the evening of 4/24/18, I've finally had enough.  As often happens, I received relatively quick service on my drink at the bar.  I also received my food quite quick.  However, as I sat as the only person at the bar, smack dab in front of the TV, and was CLEARLY watching the TV as I ate, a young waitress came up, stood right next to me, picked up the remote and, without saying one word to me, began scrolling through the satellite TV onscreen guide.  I looked at her, as if to say, \\"I'm watching the TV. What are you doing?\\".  Not an ounce of recognition on her part.  I looked around me.  No one else was at the bar or in the bar area.  She searched for whatever she was looking for for at least five minutes, then gave up without finding it.\\n\\nNow, where I come from, if someone at a bar is watching a TV, that person was there first and you DON'T change the TV station, no matter what................until, and only after, you ask that patron if they are watching the TV and if they mind if you change the channel.  It's the correct thing to do.  It's the considerate thing to do. But not her.  Nope.  She just acted as if I wasn't there.\\n\\nAfter she left, a young man arrived at the bar.  She spent the rest of my time entertaining him.  No one was interested in providing service to me after that.  After waiting and waiting and waiting, I finally had to flag down a different waitress to get my bill for me.\\n\\nAs I said, the service over the years has been spotty and inconsistent.  But this was the final straw.  If you can't teach proper service to your wait staff, you're not going to get my business.  I have other choices.

I have worked in or around Italian restaurants a good deal of my life and do make my own pasta from time to time.   This was NOT homemade pasta in any means.  If \\"Homemade\\" means they took it out of a box and cooked it, then that's about as close as your going to get.   The food tasted good, but my own personal meal, linguini with meatballs, about as basic as you can think of wasn't all that great.  The \\"Homemade\\" pasta was just like everywhere else, and the meatballs were big, but very tough.  I only ate half a meatball and a few bites of pasta, then picked off the other plates at the table.

We were the only people there from 4 to 6 pm (on a friday!).  We sat at the only table that wasn't being blasted by fans (more like wind machines), ane were promply told by the waitress to move, because that was the only table that sat 3 (what if a group of 4 come in?).  We settled for one of the other tables, noting that everything was sticky. Then the waitress came by with menus and the sake list, and wanted to take our order immediately.

The prices were pretty silly expensive for what you got.\\nAs for sake, they have some great stuff, but again, it's crazy expensive for what you get.  We wanted to compare several varieties, but were told by that increasingly displeasing waitress, that we couldn't have more than two on the table at a time.  No explanation offered.\\nI noted on the web site that the \\"chef\\"/owner, after some years of working around (including cooking at a logging camp I believe it said), she became enamored with Japanese food and cooking.  It didn't state that she has ever actually been to Japan, or studied japanese cooking, just that she loves it.  When she brought out one of the dishes, she commented that she suffered from a lack of equipment.  I guess that meant she could only cook one thing at a time.\\nMy impression was that this was supposed to be a sit and drink sake and order some small plates joint.  Kind of sip and snack as you go though the evening.  Maybe someone should tell that waitress, because she hussled us along and out the door, just like she was expecting a big rush.

It was as simple as clicking the items I wanted, putting my credit card info in (you can also chose cash on delivery) and pressing send. It came EXTREMLY quickly. I placed my order around 3pm, so it certainly wasn't their busy time, but it was still impressive speed. \\n\\nCommunication \\nIt might not be fair to ding the restaurant for this since it was grubhub who filled the order, but when I had an issue with my food, getting it resolved felt like playing the past of a seal at the circus. It was super frustration.\\n\\nFood   \\nI am unsure if they were having an off day because the reviews suggest that this place serves some pretty good food; sadly I didn't get any. What I got was a potential stomach ache if I had eaten more than a few bites of what they delivered me. Here is the fun down of the food;\\n\\nPad Thai with Crispy chicken: This place is in Brighton, right near BC. I would bet my right kidney (if I hadn't already promised it to Ginsburg) Pad Thai is one of their best sellers. College students love their pad Thai. The fact that this place couldn't get it right is sad. The noodles were greasy beyond belief, even by fast food standards. Now a towel or some antacids could have remedies that if the chicken on top of the greasy noodles weren't as rubbery as my tires. There was no way I could eat it.\\n\\nPork Buns: Now these were actually really tasty. Certainly not the best pork buns I've ever had, but they had some good flavor to them. So what's the problem you might ask? *Cue Gordon Ramsey voice* THEY WERE RAWWWR! Alright, they weren't raw but they were very pink and cool in the middle. Now this isn't a steak bun were a little medium rare never killed no one. Undercook DOES kill and this pork was very undercooked. So great taste, just cook a little longer next time.\\n\\nOverall \\nI do not see myself trying their food again unless one of my friends are ordering it and I happen to be around. They do have good reviews so I'm inclined to think they were just having an off day, but still; serving undercooked pork does not inspire me to give a second chance."},{"name":"Wild Rice Buffet","address":"843 Lee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"i will never, EVER eat here again!!! i came with my family and the moment we walked thru the doors, we were greeted with the stench from the dirty, filthy koi pond. then seated and our server finally came to take our drink orders and took 20 min to come back.. at the end of the night, i definitely had food poisoning!! a non stop mess!!

About the food-my husband and I got the Fat Farmer (vegetarian). We realized the name is derived from the really fat (as in tall) burger that comes out. It's got a bean patty, which was fairly good, and a tall order of veggies. Mostly lettuce to be exact. BUT, this was still a really good burger despite the mound of lettuce. The bean patty was either made there, or made locally because it was fresh tasting and in texture.

The ambiance was beautiful and we braved inhaling plumes of cigar smoke to enjoy the patio outside. Apart from the plumes of smoke, it was pleasant outside with the breeze and the awesome music mixing.  It was a little disturbing to see a group of guys continue to hit on our waitress through the night, and they started to put their hands on her...but she seemed to be ok with it so we stopped worrying about it.  The service was very friendly but she seemed slightly more intent on helping the guys' group next to us than us.  Our food took a very long time.  We came in around 9:40 and put our order in around 9:50. The food came out nearly around 10:20pm, which is a long wait at the end of the night when they weren't that busy.  We ordered 3 tapas and split them--the bobotie, the lobster couscous and the lamb lollipops.  The bobotie was amazing!!!!  Really the best dish.  The lamb was tender and seasoned well but the quinoa it sat on was over salted and not tasty at all.  The lobster couscous was off--not sure about it but maybe it was overpowered by the lobster and the flavors of the couscous didn't feel balanced.  Overall I feel that the fusion just didn't work in this restaurant--either all South African or creative Southern would've been better but perhaps we just ordered the wrong dishes!\\n\\n I mentioned it was my husband's birthday but there didn't seem to be any chance for a tiny dessert at the end which we were hoping for, but perhaps at a high-scale restaurant we can't expect that.  We left less than satisfied after paying such a large bill.  The waitress recommended that we try out 10 degrees south, their sister restaurant in Buckhead that serves traditional South African food.  Not sure if we will bother trying it...we will wait for our bi-annual trip to Boma at Disney World which is the most amazing meal EVER for flavors around the entire continent of Africa, beautiful ambiance, and the best value for your money."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"YES.

I was never into Indian food, but did begin to enjoy the array of vegetarian choices.  His favorite has always been the beef madras paired with naan bread.  However, I only gave three stars because, as of late, the beef madras, and even the bread, thus far have dramatically changed in flavor, texture, heat, quality, etc.  \\n\\nUsually the madras is bathed in a thick, creamy, dip-naan-bread-into sauce.  The last two times the sauce has been very watery and diluted-tasting.  The heat that is usually found in this dish has gone way down.  I used to avoid trying it because it was pretty spicy...but now it's not spicy enough; in fact, there was barely any flavor or heat at all.  Lastly, each madras \\"tub\\" is over $10, and yet we barely got five pieces of beef and a couple of potatoes.  The rest of the tub was watered down sauce.\\n\\nI don't know if they hired new chefs or what...Even the bread tastes flimsy and unflavored.

Even though the restaurant was crowded on a Friday evening, with a long line waiting to order, it was pretty easy to find seating upstairs in an overflow seating area.\\n\\nThe food was pretty good. Each order is placed on a tray, which is actually a metal cookie sheet.  The amount of fries served with each order is unbelievable!  I had ordered a vegetarian burger and homemade cheesy tots.  The burger was good. However, the cheesy tots were very strange.  Arriving in an order of 5-6 large meatball size balls, they had a nice crunch on the outside, and the inside looked and tasted like garlic mashed potatoes.  Okay--but not a \\"tot\\" like you would expect to eat with a burger, and way too much as a side for a burger. We also ordered several pieces of homemade pie (Boysenberry, chocolate cream, and strawberry cream) that were all excellent. We ordered a grilled cheese for the kids and it was just a hamburger bun with cheese--why?? \\n\\nThe issue I had with the restaurant was their customer service. I only interacted with the waitstaff when I went back in line to order dessert after we ate. (Husband didn't think we would want dessert when he ordered the first time ??)\\n\\nThere was only one person taking orders at the register.  This girl seemed oblivious to the line of people waiting (probably 15 people deep).  She showed absolutely no energy while taking our order (Slices of pie: 2 Boysenberry, 2 Chocolate Cream, and 1 Strawberry Cream) she had to ask me 3 times before she got the order right. I didn't understand the total lackadaisical, disinterested vibe. \\n\\nWe were asked to step aside while they served the pie. All of the cold orders were printed out and placed on the front (counter side) of the line. They would then prepare salad, cold sandwiches, pie, etc and match the order with the hot food that went with it.  There were two people working this part of the food prep, while there were a few others milling around.  They seemed to be just standing there, talking to each other, while waiting for the hot food portion of the orders for the \\"next ticket up\\"  There was no attempt to look at the other orders to see if there was anything \\"just cold food\\" to get out right away...they just stood there waiting & waiting for each ticket to match up to the hot food and then put it out in the order of the tickets hung up in front of them. \\n\\nAfter waiting for about 15 minutes, I stepped up to the counter and asked if someone (standing there) could get our pie, since we were just getting cold food. The woman seemed irritated that I asked.  She then proceeded to place 5 Plates of pie on the countertop and just look at me.  I had to ask her if there were a tray (like the stack of trays right behind her) that we could put the pie on, in order to carry them.  This was also an imposition on her.\\n\\nThey definitely could benefit from training their staff to be more time efficient - - - or to care at all.\\n\\nSo overall: the food was a 4 and the service was a 2"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Made our first visit to the Salty Sow recently and we had great (not quite perfect experience).

Something that should be a prerequisite for a bartender. It was as if we were bothering her. Anyway, we had a couple of drinks and dinner. Food was decent but extremely salty for us. \\n\\nThe main reason for this review is because I'm not used to restaurants adding gratuity automatically. I understand parties of 6 or more but this bar does it for everything. 18% was added. We traditionally tip 20% and go higher for amazingly service and bartender \\"friendship\\" and I would have tipped this bartender 20% simply based on easy math but my overall point is that this bartender was a total Debbie Downer but it doesn't matter to her because she knows she's getting 18% no matter how hard she works or how nice she is to patrons.

Many times a new group of customers don't know how your place operates and I see many servers being very irritated by this. Look at those dumbass customers they would think and say. They don't know what the hell they are doing. So we made a mistake in the ordering of drinks and sides because the drink station had no one there. And the meat station guy rolled his eyes and was pretty rude in the way he explained what needed to be done. Like we really inconvenienced him by ordering incorrectly. This never goes well with costumers. On top of that I stood like a moron at the drink station with my drinks with no one there for like 10min. The meat station guy 3 feet away just ignored me.

We can agree with just about every other NEGATIVE review I see on here.  Furthermore, based on our experience and how we were treated I would be very hard pressed to find that anyone, other than Mr. Clint V. Bowling, would be moved to write a positive review of this company and the service they provide.  \\n\\n     My wife and I also found this company on Living Social and thought it was a great deal for the two chairs we have been wanting to have cleaned.  I was away on business when the technicians came, but I can tell you that my wife was very uncomfortable and called me right away when a white van with no markings pulled into our drive way.  She was very uncomfortable throughout the entire experience and I will just leave it at that, as this is a bit opinionated.   \\n\\n     I returned home a couple days later to see that the cleaning did absolutely nothing to the chairs.  If anything they were a little worse than before.  Unfortunately, we wrote this off as what we get for being cheap!  Then after a few days later the chairs started to get a mildew type odor to them and and the stains got darker.  We went ahead and hired another local company to come out and do the job right, only to find that when they saw the chairs they recognized they are 100% Cotton and told us they could not touch them.   Apparently steaming cotton chairs will only ruin them.  They then suggested a national company that might be able to help.  Nope.  The second company said the exact same thing after driving all the way to our house.  Two companies that would rather lose the business..now that is customer service. Lessoned learned; do not steam clean cotton chairs and don't be pennywise, dollar foolish! \\n\\n     After learning that National Carpet Care obviously neglected proper protocol to make a dollar...or they just did not know what they were doing...I placed a call to their corporate office to share my experience and see how they would respond.  Of course, the contract's fine print leaves us 100% accountable and I also recognize I called corporate a couple months after the service when they clearly have a 14 day window for any complaints.  Yes, I agree that calling after a couple months could be excessive, however, I was immediately dismissed and it was made clear that they were going to stick to the letter of the law and I was told their hands were tied and there was nothing they could do.  Really, hand were tied?  What does that even mean?  Were they literally tied and unable to drive to my house and review our situation?  \\n\\n   Regardless, after further discussion, I was informed that they would never steam clean cotton chairs, but there are several other options they could have used.  That's great, this guy was not the one that did the work, so how could he have known what was done.  Is it possible someone made a mistake or did not know better?  Is it possible that my lovely wife who religious steams our tile floors and dress shirts suddenly did not recognize what steaming looks like?  Maybe?\\n\\n   Basically, they admitted to me that they neglected proper protocol during our service, but yet his hands were still tied.  The damage is clearly due to steaming the chairs.  If they would have a taken the time to review the workmanship, this would have been as evident to them as it was to the other 2 professionals.  I refused to tell them the names other companies I called, so he went on to bad mouth his competition and how they do not know what they are doing.  An immediate sign to me of the kind of company I was dealing with.  Neither of the other companies who came to our house said one bad thing about the job that was done, but only that it was done improperly.  Classy customer service!  Mr. Bowlings mentioned in one of his rebuttals that National Carpet Care goes to \\"great lengths to accommodate\\" their customers.  Well, those lengths are clearly stated in their contract for those of you who were wondering.  \\n\\n     While we may be partially at fault here according the contract we signed, I would recommend staying very far away from this company.  I have spent a good portion of my life in sales and working in customer service.  I understand the need for a contract to protect a business from fraudulent claims.  However, there are ALWAYS circumstances that fall outside of a contractual agreement.  Anyone in any business would recognize this and hopefully take the time to investigate the situation.  Unless of course, it happens all to often that they couldn't possibly follow up n all the complaints.  Something I wonder after seeing these reviews? \\n\\n\\nDoes National Carpet Care have to do anything about our situation?  Maybe, maybe not.  Should they have taken the time to investigate our situation and identify if they were in the wrong or not?  In my opinion and by my definition of going \\"great lengths to accommodate,\\" Absolutely."},{"name":"Is'Original","address":"1671 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"At the moment, Rod Dee is the food place I frequent the most, hands down (and not just because it's a stone's throw away from my apt, although that does help).

A pot of tea for $4.50 is a steal and $2.80 for a latte? Why, hello. Yes please. Would come back for more drinks, especially since they have a pretty good selection between black and green tea! \\n\\nMore importantly, how do the pastries stack up? Well, tiramisu was on the dry side, had a bit too much rum, and tasted kind of...fruity? It was anything but tiramisu unfortunately. I had hoped for more coffee flavor, but got greeted by what tasted like a shot in my slice. So nah, will pass on this in the future. \\n\\nThe bolero was probably my favorite--the thick chocolate  texture will satisfies the sweet tooth. The inside was still quite moist despite it being late in the day. Something about it was also fruity as well. \\n\\nAmandoa was good--still moist and sweet, but kind of tasted fruity as well? \\n\\nThe framboise tasted fruity (as expected thank goodness) tarty, and sweet. Just as it should probably. \\n\\nAll in all, the tiramisu was the biggest let down since we really wanted tiramisu after our Friday dinner, but it's our fault for wanting pastries so late in the day. Despite that, the fruity taste of all the pastries was kind of strange...I wasn't really expecting that. \\n\\nIn total, 4 huge pastries, a latte, and a pot of tea for two came out to ~$30 which is quite reasonable for four people. We will probably come back to see if the gelato is any good!"},{"name":"Turtle Creek Tavern","address":"5571 N Hamilton Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I've kissed the toad, er, turtle.\\nA new chef is in the kitchen and MY! is she good.\\nGreat veggie burger, amazing hommade nachos (with the kind of fried pita triangles as chips) that have fresh tomatoes and lettuce.\\n\\nvery unique chorizo based meatloaf.\\n\\nTap selection has expanded.

Plus, this place is amazingly consistent.  For example, my friend Sharmeela S. and I recenlty had the sizzling rice soup and we were couldn't stop raving about how it tastes EXACTLY the same as it did when we were kids.  Plus, the decor (like Hunan Lion) transports you back to an old-school Columbus dining era when people actually dressed up for dinner.  Of course, the decor is still the same, but everyone is in denim.  \\n\\nThis place has some of the best versions of American-Chinese dishes, including General Tso's, sesame chicken, Kung Pao chicken, and sweet corn chicken soup.  Furthermore, for the slightly-more authentic dishes, the Mala lamb and Hunan chicken are stellar.  On a recent visit, I tried the pan-fried noodles with shrimp and chicken (no beef) and the crunchy texture of the noodles combined with the savory gravy equated to an outstanding flavor profile.  During the same visit, I tried the salt and peppper shrimp.  They were crispy, slightly spicy, and quite a treat.  \\n\\nLastly, this restaurant has a full bar and a decent list of cocktails from a bygone era (think Mai Tais, etc.).

And that was about the only redeeming quality of this restaurant. \\n\\nI went to Rosa Mexicano with two other of my girl friends for dinner on a Sunday night. We arrived at 7:54pm, a bit late for our 7:45 reservation because we got lost in Seaport coming out of the Silver Line... \\nWe were promptly seated at a table and then neglected for about 10 minutes while we poured over the sticky menus. We quickly decided what we wanted to order, quesadillas, because they were on the cheaper side compared to everything else (over $20, and we are college students!). We also decided to get nachos to share with the table. \\n\\nNo one addressed us for at least 10 minutes to take our order and we were getting hungry. Finally, a waiter appeared, poured us water, and said he would bring chips and salsa and then left. Another 7 minutes went by, and he gave us chips and left. We wanted to order but he disappeared. Also, he did not bring us salsa. There were rarely other wait staff around, and we had to flag down another waitress to ask for our salsa. Finally our waiter brought us salsa, and we were able to order our meal. We ordered the Quesadilla De Rajas ($10) and two Quesadilla De Tinga De Res ($12.50 each), as well as Nachos De Tres Quesos ($11.50).\\n\\nWhen the nachos came, a different waiter presented it to us and cut it with 2 spoons. There were three of us, so I asked for another spoon, and he reluctantly brought it to us. \\nThe nachos were delicious! \\nThen, our waiter cleared the table of all plates and put our (used) forks on the table (gross) to make room for the next food I guess. He also took away two of our knives, so we had to ask for knives again.\\n\\nAfter waiting another 7 minutes, our food finally arrived, served by two different waiters. One waiter put a plate of quesadillas down and almost spilled my friends' water. Another waiter almost brought our meal to another table. Very disorganized and seemingly untrained staff. \\n\\nThe quesadillas were delicious but we were full from the nachos and decided to take them to go.  \\n\\nThere were rarely any wait staff in sight, as I mentioned. I had to flag someone down to ask for boxes, and we packed up our food. Then I flagged the same guy down to ask for the check. He frustratingly asked who our actual waiter was and I said I didn't know his name (because he never introduced himself to us) but described him. \\n\\nOur real waiter brought us the check, BUT OVER CHARGED US FOR OUR FOOD! He charged us $13.50 for the $10 meal and $16.50 each for the $12.50 meals. We checked the menu and it said in plain sight that it was $10 and $12.50. He tried to argue that we ordered the lunch version but got the dinner version, but nowhere on the menu did it say that and he had pointed to a random spot with a different food item. He finally said \\"fine, I'll change it and take $3 off...\\" and walked away. When he came back, we still had two $16.50 charges, and asked him to please change it again. He was upset and said we didn't tell him before, but changed it again. The manager this time presented us the newly updated checks and politely explained what had happened. We left the restaurant weirded out and frustrated at our bad experience. But, we had yummy leftover quesadillas to look forward to! \\n\\nOverall, the food was good but the awful experience with having to wait and get overcharged was not worth it. I do not understand how it took so long to be served, when the restaurant was not even busy to begin with! Would recommend finding a different place to spend your time eating in the Seaport district."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"9101 International Dr, Ste 1208","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a \\"new to Orlando\\" chain which has great burgers a great \\"Austin\\" vibe and good fries.

They also have an awesomely flavorful veggie burger and really good regular and sweet potato fries.

It was great italian bread that had a nice crust on the outside and a chewy inside. The olive oil was of high quality that had a nice vegetal flavor profile to it. \\n\\nThe side salad that we ordered had an amazing creamy balsamic dressing. The salad tasted fresh.\\n\\nThe Diavolo pasta had some heat. It doesn't hit you right away, but it creeps up on you in the back of your tongue/throat. The pasta is cooked a nice al dente.\\n\\nWe also ordered a custom pasta of tagliatelle with marinara sauce and meatballs. The meatball was tender but average.

But we don't have to - they've opened on the East side of town where we've been sorely lacking a market like this.\\n\\nLocated right off the 408 so it's perfect for stopping on the way home from work, I expect this place to get a lot of business. In fact, while we were there, the staff/owners (it's a family owned place) were walking around helping people and asking for suggestions regarding other products we'd like them to carry. They said that while they had only been open for 4 days so far, they've seen great traffic. \\n\\nThis is not like the other Asian markets in the Mills-50 Asian district. \\n\\nFor one, my wife and I don't feel like we stand out just because we only speak English.  Second, the products are better labeled and there's much better produce. Third, pretty much no meat. What meat they have comes in pre-packaged frozen items like gyoza or pork buns. \\n\\nThis is a produce market. The entire family is vegetarian. But what they lack in meat, they make up for in a wide range of tofu and gluten options. Blocks of tofu? Got them. Gluten-chicken drumsticks? Got them. Gluten steaks? Got them. Gluten ginger chicken? Gluten duck? Got those too. This place is like a vegetarian's dream.\\n\\nOf course, they also sell all the usual items at Asian markets - all the spices, teas, treats, ingredients, rice - they even sell big bags of MSG. \\n\\nPrices range from good (ie: comparable to Publix) to \\"Holy crap - what's wrong with it - that's way too cheap!\\".  Even the stuff that was priced similarly to Publix, the produce here looked better and fresher. The bananas were still green (no, I'm not confusing them with plantains - those were next to the bananas). We walked out with a cart full of produce, gluten items, rice and frozens snacks for only $35.\\n\\nIn addition to all of the produce and packaged goods, they also have a little cafe with bubble tea, iced tea and various specials. Today's special was two spicy vegetarian-ham buns for $5 and free samples of the bubble tea. The buns were perfectly sized for snacking and tasted incredible. \\n\\nThis is seriously pretty much everything I've ever wanted in an Asian market, and it's right next to home."},{"name":"A Cup of Peace","address":"3216 Arapahoe Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is ok.

The only suggestion I have is that this location either needs to clean the fish pond at the main entrance or lose the pond all together. When you walk in you are immediately turned off by the fowl odor from the pond. Not something you want to smell before you eat sushi. Please take my recommendation seriously, it was gross and I am sure I am not the only guest that has either thought about walking out or has actually walked out.

To start off i I made this reservation 3 weeks in advance for 9pm. We arrived early and waited and waited, we weren't seated until almost almost 10pm! Our party was of 15 people with two of them having a birthday, they split the party into 2 tables and the first table got their chef but the second table didn't get their chef until almost 30min later!! By the time the second chef arrived the first table was done eating. The whole point of going was to experience it together, so much for that. The chef for the second table came out, he was fun first and then you can tell he was over it. When it came to giving everyone their chicken he clearly messed up the proportions and the last people to get food only got like 4-5 pieces. Like I mentioned before we were there for a birthday and they didn't sing happy birthday until everyone was paying, not to mention the server only came by like twice. They did give a discount on the bill which was the least they could do considering everything was terrible, but when we received our bill they had the nerve add the gratuity to the total. Probably because they knew they weren't going to be receiving any otherwise. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT come to this kobe, also the parking is a nightmare.

We went a couple of hours before closing and pre-ordered for the next day! They did mention typically pre-orders are made by email five days in advance, so if this is something you can do - do it! We made puppy dog eyes and said we were from Miami and an exception was made - thank you La Barbecue! Their menu is priced by the pound, but you can also order by the piece (like 3 pork ribs). \\n\\nWe failed to know beef ribs are HUGE and pre-ordered two only to learn at the moment of pickup that they're almost the size of a forearm! So if you're ignorant like us - now you know!\\n\\nOverall, the flavors were bold and definitely worthy of their title as one of the best BBQ places in Austin. Their Frito Pie is also worth the mention as it's equal parts different as is delicious! Their potato salad and beans are satisfying but not the typical comforting BBQ food I was expecting and craving. Kudos to La Barbecue for experimenting and succeeding!

We've seen it on Yelp a few times whenever I searched for ramen places in the area. It is located near the Oak Square YMCA (I should have hit the guy before eating!), but I never noticed it when I walk by (maybe because of their gray/neutral colored curtains that don't draw attention). Parking in the area is fairly easy - street parking, no meters. They open at 12pm and on Sunday, wasn't very busy. \\n\\nOrder at the register when you come in and then pick a table yourself. They bring food over to you as it comes out. You grab your own utensils and clean up after yourself. Definitely an interesting set up!\\n\\nThe lunch special promotion (and dinner special) has been extended to July. You can pick a rice, noodle or soup (noodle soup) dish, two small apps and a drink for $10.12 (I guess the 12 cents for Twelve Hour is cute...). This is actually a GREAT DEAL!! I ordered the Sakura Falls Ramen (one of the most popular items), two orders of wings (3 pieces per order) and juice. The other half got the Old School Noodle Soup, fried dumpling and fried shumai (3 pieces each) and Thai iced tea. Meal sets come with house salad. The app portions were fair - everything was most definitely fried (can I say it's too fried??). Dumpling and shumai was just okay and the wings were def fried chicken wings but had no flavor without the duck sauce. Our entrees were large and filling (we brought some home!). Unfortunately, the Sakura ramen was very bland for me - the portions of meat was very large, but they were cooked very well done, so it was a little hard to eat. The noodles were okay (good but nothing out of the ordinary) and the soup didn't have much taste at all. I wasn't really impressed, especially when it is one of the most popular dishes.

There was only one other customer in there checking out the pre-made drinks. Seeing as how I am not at all familiar with the menu, I just went up to the counter and said \\"What would you recommend for me if I just finished a run and haven't eaten lunch?\\" Both associates looked at the menu in consideration and then said that the \\"Super Spirulina\\" would be a great option. (For the record I had to ask them to repeat themselves multiple times bc I had no idea what they were saying). As they said it a third time, my eyes caught it on the menu board. I saw that it had bananas and strawberry and I looked no further. Two of my favorite fruits--it sounded great to me!\\n\\nObviously being the only customer in there, I was handed my drink very quickly. I was super surprised to see that it was green when she handed it to me. It was a very leafy green color so I got nervous. I wanted something that tasted fruity, not like lettuce! She reassured me that it was just the spirulina that gave it that color (again a word I had never heard), but that it should overall taste fruity. I took one sip and I was SOLD! I loved the taste!! Super creamy, rich, fruity, and flavorful! It honestly felt like I was drinking dessert out of the cup. I loved it! She explained to me what spirulina was and that it had ten grams of protein for just a little scoop. I knew it would make for a great post-run beverage! It was so good in fact that I sipped it all the way home (3 blocks) in 30 degree weather! \\n\\nI would definitely go back because the associates were super friendly, gave me a great recommendation for my needs and the smoothie was excellent. The only thing that takes this place from a 5 to a 4 is that a smoothie costs $9 (keep in mind, I had a free coupon on my visit here.) Just a tad too pricey for me.

It's cavernous, not intimate. Cold this time of year. Wear a warm jacket, maybe a hat. Big TV (projection, I think) with sports, but no sound. Music was unmemorable. What I do remember is the awful speakers, probably not helped by the acoustics of the place.

But then I noticed off to the side of the taplist it says all beers are $5. Pour size varies from 4oz to a pint (16 I guess, they didn't look imperial).

It's one of my favorite burger places and always recommend this place to people.\\n\\nThis time however was disappointing. Now part of it was that we got the food to go and I think that the food itself suffered from having to wait to eat it fresh but we had a one year old at home and didn't know if we'd be able to find a spot to sit. \\n\\nFirst thing, we had ordered it to go, and then even REMINDED them that it was to go as we finished paying and they still made it for there. Then they had to repackage it all up to go which also probably made the food suffer even more. \\n\\nWe ordered a grilled cheese for my daughter and it was the weirdest grilled cheese, they made it with burger buns and it just wasn't very appealing at all. Even my one year old was not a fan of it. \\n\\nI decided to step out of my comfort zone and get the Union Club, which is supposed to be on \\"house bread\\" even as their menu states and as all photos on yelp show. Well I'm not sure if they were just out of bread for both this and the grilled cheese but again was on a burger bun, and it was... good flavor but definitely not as good as it should have been on normal bread. If they had told us that they were out of bread and asked to substitute we probably would have changed our order but they didn't say anything and instead we got some weird sandwiches. \\n\\nLastly, my FAVORITE thing in the world is their coconut cream pie. We are from Washington so we travel 4 hours to get here and I have to say, it was extremely disappointing this time. The coconut custard had been over thickened and tasted like paste.. it was not very good at all and SO disappointing since I only get it once every 1-2 years. \\n\\nOverall, I love Tilt, always recommend it... but this time we were very disappointed in our journey for mediocre food. Maybe it's going downhill. :("},{"name":"Mudflats Bar and Grill","address":"31 Columbus St","city":"Galena","stars":"4","text":"Parking is a bit tight, but a spot opened up as we were driving around.

Not anymore. We arrived at 7:30pm on a Sunday night (they are open until 9:30pm) and there was one occupied table. The server was friendly, sat us right away and got our drinks. Since I love sushi I went to that bar first and chose from 8 different kinds. The sushi was wrapped very tight and if I did not see that they were supposed to be different kinds I would not have known. My biggest complaint on the sushi is that almost all of them had cucumber in them which is fine but it felt and tasted like they only used the peelings from the cucumber from the peeled cucumber dish.\\n\\nThen I tried the hot food, which was not very hot. Most dishes were picked over with not much left in the trays. Most of the food was dried out, tough and tasteless which was a shame especially with the shrimp and calamari dish and the lobster dish. The lobster was so overcooked that the claw meat was so rubbery that I could not even get it out of the claw. The head-on shrimp were rubbery and had no flavor, the accompanying calamari were also rubbery and tasteless. The coconut shrimp was ok but chewy. \\n\\nWhile I can understand not having full trays with only one customer on a Sunday night, the food must maintain a set standard. Five more customers came in while we were there and the same food was still there, nothing new was brought out.\\n\\nI may give them one more try on another earlier day but with their prices going up every time I go, it maybe a while.

Parking in the area is relatively easy to find. There are numerous meter options on both sides of Beacon St. Just be wary that some of the meter spots directly next to the train stain are pull in spots. There's also the Centre St. West Parking Lot about a block or two away from Hops. You enter through Winchester St(?). If you're environmentally conscious then opt for the Green Line and get off at the Coolidge Corner stop. \\n\\nHops N Scotch Brookline is set up differently from the Cambridge location. When you walk in, there is a small dining area to the left and a full bar to the right that wraps around the staircase. The bar area has plenty of TVs so if you want to catch a game this is the place to do it. The staircase leads to additional dining. I took a peek upstairs and it was pretty spacious! There are tables for large groups and smaller ones for a more intimate feeling. There are large windows so plenty of light during the day or people watching opportunities. Whatever you fancy. They also have a live DJ on the 2nd floor on Friday nights when the dining area turns into a lounge area. \\n\\nAlright on to the important stuff - Food! Wait...giving a shout out to our waiter, Alex. He was really attentive and knowledgeable.

It was my first time trying scotch egg and I didn't know what it was made of but I was pleasantly surprised by it. I really liked the pasta. It was simple - a classic. The pasta was made perfectly al dente. To top off dinner we finished with some dessert: a mango mousse, a cheesecake, and a peanut mousse brownie. Each were paired with a cherry cordial shot.

So just south of Piedmont on Peachtree, this restaurant is a comfortable, very elegant treat and addition to the area and a true must try. I brought my son in for a night of flavors and experiences we have not had before with authentic Indonesian fares which did not disappoint. \\n\\nWe started with one of their many signature martinis and could not decide so ordered 3 appetizers while we pondered the menu. We started with the tuna tacos which I love- small, crunchy, tuna/avocado/sesame oil, cilantro- perfect bites for what I was hoping for. Then the oysters ceviche , NW pacific oysters with scallions, lemon grass, served on a slate board . These are very tasty and excellent starts for the night. We then came back as I noticed the lobster bisque on the specials menu and had to try it. Absolutely the best surprise for me as I love lobster bisque and this did not disappoint. \\n\\nLarge lobster claw meat in the bottom of a bowl, served table side and with the bisque poured over the lobster to form a perfect presentation . The taste was like non I have had.  A bit of turmeric and cumin in a seafood bisque that was a pleasing toe the pallet as it was to eat. The lobster was plentiful, the soup was flavorful, rich and the Asian accents made this a true delight. \\n\\nFor our entrees we settled on the Opor Bebek- generous portion of sliced duck breast and leg confit, with foie gras, vegetables, traditional white rice covered with a succulent sauce of meat drippings, coconut milk, some Indonesian spices. Not greasy or tough, cooked a perfect MR, this has to be the best duck I have had ever, anywhere. I truly enjoyed the flavor, the texture and only yearned for more vegetables to help me ensure I was able to scoop up all the sauce and rice so my plate was completely cleaned. I definitely cleaned the plate and highly recommend this dish. \\n\\nMy son chose his favorite of rack of lamb or the Gule Kambing- another excellent presentation and tasty dish of generous portions of MR lamb, rice and vegetables also in a uniquely  different Indonesian sauce that made this lamb tender, yet familiar for those lamb lovers who expect the best. We did ensure we got all the meat of the bone so was not embarrassed to pick the legs up with our fingers and chew the best of the meat off getting every bite and again, cleaning the plate. \\n\\nEnding with the Colenak- traditional Indonesian fermented cassava with black rice and baileys, in a rich sugary sauce that was seemingly like a bread pudding but again, uniquely different and delicious. !! Each bite was a treat. I opted for the Kolak Pisang- bananas poached in coconut milk with a small cake/pie of bananas, banana liquor, elegant cookies and both deserts with homemade ice cream and fruit. \\n\\nBetween each course, we opted to try several of the mixologist special martinis which I have posted on my pictures. My favorite 2 being the spicy margarita ( I'll call it that by taste) with jalape√±o, rim dipped in spices and sugar for a stout yet pleasing cocktail to enjoy. The Lychee martini had 3 Lychee fruits on a skewer over the top and a martini that was had an after taste of - flowers! I felt as if I had taken the essence of a rose and paired it with the fresh taste of the Lychee fruit ( Another Indonesian surprise) for a light yet refreshing martini. \\n\\nWin has a wonderful and clean atmosphere, built in fireplace wall with changing colors, a beautiful bar and elegant seating area for the upscale eatery it is. As a newcomer to the  market, I will be back for the short ribs, and try maybe the 4 course Indonesian set menu ( only $32) but want to be sure I get all they have to offer for their culture. I have never been to a true Indonesian restaurant and with the elegant design, wine list and ambiance, my next visit will be with a date and friends as this is a very romantic and classy addition with valet parking, easy in and out onto Peachtree and near to the other venues in the area we've come to love. \\n\\nThe staff is relentless in their kindness and attentiveness completing an evening that was a true delight and a place we can truly come back to and never have the same thing twice- accept the martinis of course. It is truly the perfect addition to the area and something you can visit a couple of times a week and enjoy each night as a different experience.

We also got the Seco, which tasted nothing like a Seco from Peru. The flavors were just not Peruvian. It does not come with beans like the traditional version. There was no carrots or peas either.

It looked pretty good. \\n\\nSadly, that initial satisfaction was short-lived. \\n\\nThe pizza had almost no sauce on it and the crust looked and tasted like it came right out of the freezer. It was very bland and had a cardboard texture. That and little to no sauce, results in a very dry pizza. \\n\\nThat said, the atmosphere is nice and the counter service was very friendly. The building does sit back off the highway and is easy to miss if you've never been. \\n\\nAll told, I can't recommend their pizza as it wasn't cheap, was undersized (16\\"; most extra larges start at 18 and go up), had no sauce, and a dry, stale crust. \\n\\nI will not be back. \\n\\nYou can do much, much better."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Love Italian food so hard for me to not be happy at a Italian restaurant but this one was top notch.

You won't get an amazing authentic Italian meal, but you will (typically) get a fairly consistently good meal with lots of food and pretty good service. \\n\\nAmbiance\\nThey all look pretty much the same. Cute Italian decorations on the wall, large dining rooms with booth and table seating. Free WiFi. Large parking lot. Small-ish bar area. \\n\\nService\\nDefinitely use their call ahead seating option (or get on the waitlist online) as waits can be very long on weekends. Service is generally fairly good. On this occasion the hostess seemed bored and didn't say much. The server was fairly good.  Checked up often and brought drink refills without even being asked. He seemed a bit rushed, though, so we didn't really feel welcome to slow down and take our time. \\n\\nFood\\nWe usually get the trio appetizer with toasted meat ravioli, fried mozzarella, and and zucchini bites. We do miss the chicken strips option as part of the platter they got rid of some time ago. The ravioli are always the highlight.  Wonderful toasty bites filled with a flavorful beef and pork mix. The mozzarella is usually ok. It never seems crispy enough. The zucchini bites were new and filed with a soft mixture of hot zucchini inside with a crispy outside. \\n\\nEvery entree comes with soup or salad and unlimited breadsticks.  The salad is usually very good with crisp lettuce and fresh vegetables. Their signature dressing is good but very salty. They have a great variety of soups as well. Try the Zuppa Toscana - a hearty sausage potato soup perfect for cold nights. The chicken and gnocchi is also good. The breadsticks have been an Olive Garden signature for forever. Lightly coated with a garlic butter spread they're usually awesome. Be careful you don't get a stale or burned batch, though. Tip: you can ask for a bag of breadsticks to take home with you!\\n\\nOlive Garden food can be very heavy and not so good for you. They've unveiled more healthy options, though. This time we tried one of them - the 600 calorie chicken giardino. Grilled chicken with tons of veggies in chicken lemon herb sauce with pasta. This was really very good and hard to believe it's only 600 calories. They also had their never-ending classics special going on during this visit. Sort of like their unlimited pasta special but offering more choices to pick from. We went for the spaghetti with meat sauce ($11.99 - $2 more than just the single serving spaghetti with meat sauce). Your first portion will be regular size; any refills will be a much smaller portion. Tip: you can order a refill and take a bite or two then take the rest home. The spaghetti with meat sauce is always very good. Perfectly cooked pasta and a hearty flavorful meat sauce. \\n\\nFinally, dessert!  They have many to pick from. This time we got the trio of mini desserts. One amaretto tiramisu, one limoncello mousse, and one dark chocolate caramel. The tiramisu is always a favorite with a wonderful amaretto flavor. The limoncello is also very good. This time they all seemed a bit frozen and improperly defrosted. It didn't detract too much from the taste, though. Other favorites are the lemon cream cake and the regular (non-amaretto) full size tiramisu. Definitely save room for dessert!\\n\\nMojo\\nOlive Garden is not your local authentic Italian restaurant but will generally provide a lot of pretty consistently good Italian food with good service. \\n\\nTip: join their e-club online for a free appetizer welcome coupon and other offers during the year"},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Best dinner ever!!

Perhaps tourists are just parroting what they feel they need to say about a place because \\"everyone says they're good\\" instead of giving their true feelings. I have to be honest when I review something. Long wait, no big deal, as it was a holiday and a big touristy area (beautiful \\"North End\\" Boston). Kind of a small, cramped place, but it's an old established restaurant and had a bit of charm to it. The lobster ravioli (appetizer) was excellent with a very tasty sauce and the (only good) best part of the meal. The food overall was just okay to not very good. Kind of bland to be honest. We all had different meals, all our sauces were just okay. The pasta, while it did feel fresh and hand-made, was just okay due to the mediocre sauces. None of us took more than a few bites (other than the lobster ravioli--which was completely eaten--4 ravioli in all). For the amount of money we spent, we expected better flavor/taste, but we were on vacation so \\"live and learn and try a variety of things\\" is how we looked at it. We're glad we didn't finish our meals because they were pretty big portions and we would've been stuffed with mediocre food, so we were were able to enjoy some other things that Boston's version of Little Italy had to offer (like Bova's tiramisu and Modern Pastry's traditional cannoli)."},{"name":"Southside Flying Pizza","address":"2206 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the worse service in delivery for pizza EVER\\nIM DONE W WAITING AND the pizza ordered was not correct.

Some people say that the BBQ Chicken Pizza from Old Railroad is better than Pat's, but I completely disagree. I won't get this pizza anywhere else because I'm afraid it won't live up to Pat's standard. \\n\\nThe Buffalo Chicken Calzone with blue cheese is very, very good and all of my school friends are addicted to it. \\n\\nI've tried the Thanksgiving Turkey Calzone; if you like having your whole Thanksgiving meal wrapped in dough, try it.

Get the fries! They're crispy on the outside and wonderfully chewy on the inside. I got an order with my friend and they were gone in seconds. I just couldn't help myself; they were THAT good. \\n\\nI've tried the Chicken and Broccoli Calzone as well, but the time that I got it, it was just bland and tasteless.

You can customize your own burger however you'd like! I ordered the Classic (Angus beef) the first time, and I ordered the Primetime burger (Kobe beef) at the second visit. \\nBe sure to try all of their sauces! Especially the sassy sauce! They also have an excellent white truffle aioli, if that suits your taste palate. \\nTheir ketchup is made with sugar instead of corn syrup. Their sodas are very unique and they also have sugar instead of corn syrup. \\nThey make their own hand cut French fries, both white potato and sweet potato. And they also have specialized fries, such as truffle fries, and spicy honey sweet potato fries. \\nI didn't try their milkshakes, but my friend ordered one and said it was amazing. They also offer to add alcohol to your milkshake, but that seems kinda gross to me (just my personal preference). I also didn't like the arugula that they put on the Primetime burger, but that is also just for my personal taste... so I just brushed them off the burger and enjoyed it immensely! \\nIf you like a high quality burger with unique toppings and sides, trying this place is a must!!"},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Thank you Johnny for an amazing birthday drink.

The piece had one end that was crunchy but the other side was soft and made it for a great combination on the bread. Before my diving into my entree I also enjoyed a seasonal fruit bowl (strawberries, blueberries and green apples with honey) and it was quite refreshing. The main dish I got to enjoy was the cottage cheese blintz and I can't recommend it enough. The blueberry sauce that they use for it was outstanding and I think I tasted some lemon with it that complimented the cheese quite well. I took a few bites of a Buttermilk Pancake too and it was great, used some blueberry from the blintz plate and wished I could've just doused the pancakes with it. They have some delicious coffee on top of it all too, I enjoyed a well made Americano. \\n\\nPancake Social is located next to Mountain High Outfitters, parking out front of the location is ideal but it being Ponce City Market can make it a little difficult at times to find a parking spot. The interior is very spacious for a restaurant within that area, would not recommend groups over 8 or 10 for walk ins but looks like it can be done. They have assortments of booths and tables in the back and smaller tables in the front for those only coming in for coffee. It looks quite modern in the front and almost diner like towards the back area, the color and pancake tiles are really awesome. \\n\\nOur server Michael was very kind and attentive, he assisted with suggestions and descriptions of their menu items.

I ordered one of the multiple surf & turf options: half rack of ribs, steak tips, and stuffed shrimp. All were delicious. Humongous portions! I subbed saut√©ed broccoli for my potatoes, and that broccoli might have been the highlight of my meal. Extra crunchy, yet cooked just enough, with lots of garlic and herbs and butter. Yummy.

The first thing that caught my attention was the ambiance and the decor of the restaurant. It's a nice dim lit setting that really relaxes you in my opinion. But sadly for my first experience here that's where the good part ends. After our party was seated it seemed as if the night was gonna be a hit, but slowly started going down Hill from there. The first thing i noticed was that our Cesar salads was noticeably smaller than other tables next to us for some reason. Our server \\"Linden\\" seemed to have a very bad attitude for no apparent reason. His knowledge of portion size when it comes to ounces of lobster was off. He told us one thing but when it came out it was definitely smaller than what he said, and for the price your paying you're expecting more. Throughout the night Linden's attitude seemed to get worse as he was very short with answering questions, and condescending. The kitchen kept sending out medium steaks when medium well is what was ordered. At one point the manager walked over to our table and reached over us to grab a wine menu for another table without saying excuse me first! Towards the end of the evening when things were wrapping up, i asked for my check not having prior knowledge that they don't separate checks. Linden our server very rudely said no we don't do that. Even though i saw him do it for the table next to me. One of the staff threw away someone's food instead of asking if they wanted it boxed up. Then to top my night off Linden our server took my food to box it up which was basically 80% of my meal brought it back to me just for me to get home and see that he gave me a box full of spinach which wasn't even a part of my meal. So needless to say my first experience was everything but amazing! I've had better service from a server at applebees who wasn't guaranteed 18% gratuity when the check came.

We're always open to something new. The waiter was great and very attentive to us. He told us that we were sitting in their newly expanded dinning room which I must add looked like a different restaurant all together from the rest of the very cool decor and design of the rest of the eating area. As my  brother (an artists) best describes it, \\"how very monotone.\\" It literally consisted of 2 (unattractive) muted colors. But the wicker chairs were quiet comfortable... albeit a little difficult to pull in since they are big & clunky but definitely comfortable.\\nAt first glance it seemed as though they were having a \\"blue haired special\\" and we were the only ones that didn't know it. However,  these were the hip/chic \\"blue hairs\\" of Atlanta as we overheard the table next to us discussing their latest art purchase. Our food was delicious. We ordered the lightly fried squid & veggies (aka Piccolo fritto) for the app. It was incredibly good. I could have eaten that just for my meal. It came with a malt vinegar to top it off on the side and we loved it. My brother got the beet salad and he commented on how beautiful the presentation was and the salad itself was delicious. My sister-in-law whom I've mentioned in previous reviews (Wysteria) is a Celiac and has challenges finding places that genuinely care to accommodate people with gluten allergies. They were very attentive to her needs from the meal to the dessert. My husband had pistachio ice-cream for dessert. This isn't the standard bright green outta the tub kind, this was homemade and absolutely heavenly... a must if you like pistachios. \\nOverall, service was great, yes- definitely pricey but the food is very good AND as my husband points out, it was not one of those loud chattery restaurants (ie: Wysteria or Two Urban Licks) where you can't hear the person across from you talk.

The thought of applauding or condemning a place based on my tastes just doesn't vibe well with me... as if I deemed it unworthy then it must be so. It is a concept that after 800+ reviews and 75+ updates I'm still not comfortable with, which explains why only about half of my 883 reviews (updates included) are about food! It's such a subjective thing that who's to say just because I like it, you will too?\\n\\nThat being said if you come to Clay's and don't like the wings... well...  you need to check into a hospital for testing immediately! It is a strong possibility your taste buds are dying.\\n\\n\\nTHE SCENE \\n\\nIf you read my reviews then you know I live life in different phases of obsession. One month ribs may be my muse, the next may be oxtails. The month after that it might be burgers, or cheesesteaks, or pho! This month (for the time being) it happens to be wings. I just can't seem to get enough of wings lately. So on my last check-in @ a local wing joint, my yelp friend Kristin B sent me a message saying I must try Clay's. Well, that's like telling a crackhead where to find a good stash! It stayed on my mind for over two weeks until I was able to navigate myself to the front door of this small and unassuming bar.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and greeted me as I walked through the doors from the bar counter all the way in the back of the restaurant. The contrast in light is so different from walking in from outside that it took my eyes a few seconds to adjust and see just where the greeting originated. \\n\\nIt was not very crowded so I chose a table near the front of the restaurant. It's a tad dark to the rear and knowing I was going to take pics I wanted better lighting. I probably should have viewed the menu online before coming because the sheer amount of delicious flavors was mind boggling and threw my decision meter way off. I'm certain I annoyed my waitress with my indecisiveness. So I tried sorting through reviews by friends to gather the best recommendation on which flavor of wings to order. Frustrated that my connection was bad, I just \\"winged it\\" (hahaha get it) and ordered 10 Honey BBQ, 10 Hot and 10 Lemon Pepper. However, as my server was leaving to put my order in the system, I was finally able to get a signal. After speed-reading a few reviews, I quickly changed it to 5 Honey BBQ, 5 Garlic Parmesan, 10 Jerk and 10 Hot. I regret not ordering the Lemon Pepper, but here is my opinion of each:\\n\\n\\n30 WINGS | $32.95\\n\\nHOT (4.5 stars)\\nSeekers of heat will not be disappointed. Made my nose run and eye water before I even tasted them! LOL\\n\\nJERK (5 stars) + .50\\nBy far my favorite of the four flavors I sampled. They were flavorful and delicious. No doubt this flavor will be part of every future order on future visits. \\n\\nHONEY BBQ (4.5 stars) + .50\\nLOVED them! The sauce was perfect, but I wish they would cook the sauce onto the wings instead of drowning them in it. \\n\\nGARLIC PARMESAN (2.5 stars) + .50\\nMeh, just didn't taste great to me. Note: this flavor was the first one I tried, so my palate was clean. \\n\\nFRENCH FRIES (3.5 stars)\\n\\nSWEET TEA (3.85 stars)\\nThere is enough sugar in this tea to instantly cause diabetes! Although I love sweet tea that is undoubtedly sweet, this could have used just slightly less sugar. \\n\\n-----\\nSIDE NOTE: There is a .50 cent surcharge for every wing flavor added to an order (not counting the first flavor). So if you order 30 wings as I did and choose four different flavors, you will pay an additional $1.50.\\n-----\\n\\n\\nAMBIANCE\\nDark, man-cave, hole in the wall neighborhood sports bar vibe. \\n\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\n\\nLove wings? Get yourself over here! I'm not ready to call them the best restaurant for wings in Atlanta, but they are very, very good for sure! The smoked wings at The Albert (near Little Five Points) still retain the title of my absolute favorite Atlanta area wings. However, I may change my mind once I try the lemon pepper wings on my next visit.

But, beyond this amazing deal Life of Pie has more to offer.....\\n      All of the pizza is excellent here. I've had 4 so far and they were all unique and delicious. Salads and sides are tasty, nothing extraordinary, but hey you aren't coming here for an amazing salad, you're coming here for the pizza. \\n     It's clear the dough undergoes a good fermentation period, it's tasty and has great crumb. The pizza's are also fully cooked and aren't soupy in the center as so many wood fired pizzas are (as most places don't know how to properly run their ovens). Ingredients taste fresh and I assume they do their best to use local produce and meats. The taplist here is always small but well curated and it always includes some great beers to pair with pizza. \\n     The space is airy and there is plenty of space between seats. The room is full of the wood fire smoke smell, always a good sign. The staff greet you with a smile and treat you like a friend, which is notable improvement over the vast majority of PDX's so called top pizza spots. And no one is yelling \\"corner\\" every 5 second as they do at some places (read my apizza scholls review). \\n     For the reviewers who complain about the chaos of the line and the ordering process, well as a 10 year veteran of Brooklyn I can just say you never really want to go to a hot pizza spot on Friday or Saturday night. Go somewhere else those nights, hit Life of Pie on Tuesday evening!!!! You won't wait and there will be no chaos. \\n    This is some of the best pizza in the city. Don't miss it.

The bacon was also extremely dry. When the bill came I looked down and saw they also charged me for a side of hash browns, which I did not receive, nor ask for. I took one look at it and told her she needed to remove a full plate of food off that bill for all the hassle I went through. \\n\\nShe did as I asked, and removed a \\"Trucker\\" off my bill and the unknown hash browns. \\nI explained I was not pleased with what happened today, and mentioned I would be \\"yelping\\" this. \\n\\nThis was a completely horrible experience and I may one day return, it sure won't be anytime soon.

The app offers all members when they check in, a glass \\"taste\\" of a premium wine of the day for $2. When you get your receipts, you scan the barcode and once you hit $250/year; you get the $2 taste, free amuse bouche and discounts on wine. \\n\\nSince I'm still just a cellar member, I ordered the $2 taste and got the amuse bouche of the day for $4. They have good prices for an airport, wine flights are between $12 - $20 and the appetizers start at $3.

It turns into more of a bar at night. The atmosphere on a Saturday night was surprisingly mellow. It's not an Arena District atmosphere. This is more of a come and chillax bar. It's good for actually being able to have a conversation. The music selection is reflective of this. It's not a grope and humping atmosphere. The jukebox was playing things like Piano Man. I think the koi pond is nice.It adds a calm to the place. There was a small group around the pool table. At the bar it wasn't crowded at all. Patrons were pretty well behaved. It never gets rowdy in here. This is a good place if you need to be able to have a conversation while enjoying your cocktails. \\n\\nI would come here again with a group to chill.

We also went for the beef brisket, and while not quite as good as the pork, it was certainly amazing in it's own way- not too fatty, well smoked, good enough to warrant the stomachache I had later from knowingly eating way too much.  Sides were not the stars of the show, but adequate- I personally loved the slaw, which was sweet and tangy, and thought the beans were pretty standard, but good.  \\n\\nThe only complaint we really had was that the beer selection is limited to cans, nothing on taps and limited- first world problem.

Came out cold, rare/raw, unsalted, not prime (I know the difference between USDA Prime and Choice), and cut from the chuck-end of the strip with the huge sinew running through the middle. And gristle. The mashed potatoes($8?) came out hot, but gluey, unsalted and flavorless. I ate them out of a fit of pique. The Brussels sprouts ($10?) were steamed - not roasted - and thus tasting of sulphur. Again, unsalted and flavorless (except for the sulphur and the bits of steamed bacon). I did not eat them, even out of hate, which I am wont to do. \\n\\nThe upshot: The food misfires aren't about a bad day; they're choices by the chef (ordering cheaper cuts for travelers unlikely to return), the suppliers (maybe slipping in lesser quality product to a too-busy-to-do-anything-about-it kitchen) and the line cooks (not cooking to proper temp, sending out unseasoned food). I'll come back for the bar and try the Italian specialties or burgers, to give them another shot. Won't be getting a steak here again though.

Their happy hour starts early, 11 AM, but also ends kind of early,6 PM , so if you're a cube-dweller in downtown, the happy hour may be limited to weekends for you. The happy hour is a deal of deals, but very limited. You get their margarita pizza for $5 and a pint of microbrew for $3. In this day and age, that is quite a deal for the bustling Williams corridor. \\n\\nThe layout of Life of Pie is pretty good as well. Very casual and not at all stuffy which is nice. You order at the register and tip at the same time. They hand you your beverage and a number then you find a seat. If weather permits, their sidewalk tables are really nice and give you a good vantage point for people watching. They are also right next to Tin Bucket so you can overhear some funny, drunk conversations. Also make sure to put some of that chili oil on your pizza, really kicks it up a notch.\\n\\nTheir regular menu has the margarita pizza for $10 so I hope it is a bit larger because I'd be a bit annoyed paying that much for a personal pizza. It's a good pizza, but it isn't anything to write home about. It'd also be nice if the happy hour menu offered a pizza with toppings for an upcharge. They could also use more taps."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm a pretty big fan of barbecue, and when I see that a place as more than 1000 reviews with above a 4.0 rating, I automatically steer towards it. \\n\\nAtmosphere: since it's a food truck, there's not much you can do but stand in the dreadful sun because of the long wait. As you get closer to the sun, you can eventually stand under the tents that they have placed out. There are long, wooden tables that can sit up to 20 people. There are lots of flies everywhere, but other than that, it's just a normal, outside seating.\\n\\nFood: because my group consisted of 12 people, we ordered 5 pounds of brisket, 2 pounds of sausage, and a rack of pork ribs. We wanted the beef ribs but they were out. The brisket was ok..I wasn't a big fan of it. It wasn't a \\"melt in your mouth\\" experience, but the flavor was definitely there. The sausage had a kick and was kind of spicy. My favorite were the ribs - they were tender and fell off the bone. We also ordered chipotle slaw as a side, which was also really spicy.

Floataway Cafe was my latest Star Provisions experience. I am wildly mesmerized by the ingenue of the founders of Star Provisions. There is obvious attention to detail, from execution of food to restaurant ambiance for not one but five restaurants. I totally dig their website, too, which btw has a recipe tab. Wowsers! Each restaurant I have been to has such a different energy and identity, but they share one commonality, which is excellent, mind blowing, food. \\n\\nI adore Floataway Cafe. While the other Star Provisions  restaurants, including Quinones, are bunched together in Midtown, Floataway Cafe is located in a less conspicuous area, adding to the restaurant's calm atmosphere. It's seriously one of my favorite places for casual fine dining. Seriously. I love the ambiance so incredibly much, I am going to scream. The restaurant space was created in a former factory. There are even docking platforms. Think TwoUrbanLicks. However, unlike twourbanlicks, which is trendier and more bustling, Floataway Cafe, as the name suggests, is really about having a relaxing dining experience. Tranquil blue and cool silver colors are warmed by the wicker furniture and soft lighting. It's such a beautiful contrast. I appreciate the clean patterns on the upholstery and classic shapes of furniture. The outdoor dinning space is confined by walls, but opened to the skies, which emphasized the pretty night. I can only imagine how nice it must be in the daytime. Some of the walls are created by garage doors replaced with glass panels. The space must get highlighted with natural lighting in the daytime. I love the intimate dining spaces, which are separated by light curtains. Dinner is served at 6, but there isn't a closing time. MESMER.IZED.\\n\\nSpeaking of mesmerized, I was lost in time and space every time our French server came by. I tried so hard to fawn discretely, but he was already killing me softly with his tall, dark, and handsome-ness. Why did he come with a French accent also!? GAHH. so effing beautiful \\n\\nFloataway Cafe serves contemporary foods with various European influences. So the menu has interesting selections. The menu does change frequently, but here is what we ordered: \\n\\n1. gulf blue crab fritter w peperonata ( popular item)  \\nOne fairly decent sized ball of goodness. It's enough to share between two personages. Good amount of crab in the ball, haha. I am a lover of crabs, therefore this was yum! \\n\\n2. chicken liver bruschetta w red onion jam (popular item). This was a fairly good dish. I love chicken liver, but perhaps the red onion jam cloaked the liver taste too much for me. It's a personal problem. \\n\\n3. squash pizza with - san marzano tomato, squash, pancetta, ricotta, \\noregano. FIRST, I loveee ricotta on pizza. So dopee. It's like clouds of creamy goodness on my pizza. I loveee it. I also enjoyed biting into random slices of bacon on this pizza. Last, it's neapolitan. WIN. \\n\\n4. wood grilled eden farms pork loin, spaghetti squash, \\ncranberry mostarda \\nI did not order this dish because I eat a lot of spaghetti squash already and was not in the mood for pork. However, the pork loin was very good and tender. \\n\\n5. pan roasted moulard duck breast, hen of the wood mushrooms, \\nbrussels sprout leaves, parsley \\nServed, per recommendation, rare. This is a fine dish. The duck was very tender and I enjoyed the earthy flavors from the shroom. I like the added touch of dill oil. \\nVery good dish. \\n\\n6. Tasting Dessert Plate. I highly recommend ordering this for dessert. It was enough for the four of us. You get 3 of their popular items, albeit smaller portion than if ordered individually. There were: \\n\\na. warm toffee pudding, \\nbrown butter gelato\\nThis was my favorite. I love the consistency of bread pudding soaked in the saccharine syrup. \\n\\nb. lemon tart, toasted meringue,\\nbuttermilk sorbet.\\nSecond favorite. It's quite tart, which I like.

The burger itself was dry on the inside but greasy on the outside and soaked the bottom of the brown bag instantly.\\n\\nAs for cleanliness, this location is a bit worse than others. We arrived at noon (an hour after it opens at 11am) and several of the tables were dirty and the bathroom was messy (during my visit, the women's bathroom had a bucket of dirty water and a mop in the center of the floor)."},{"name":"Oyatsupan Bakers","address":"16025 SW Regatta Ln","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"This place has some quality baked goods, not just your typical bread and donuts, but other delicious items.

Usually the milk tea and the boba are both the right amount of sweet and yummy but sometimes they're not. I've come in a couple of times later in the night where the tea isn't sweet or the boba's mushy which sucks! Just because it's later in the day doesn't mean they can slack off, just saying. The jasmine milk tea is pretty good too, a little lighter than the normal milk tea, and the basil fried chicken is delicious. It's kinda oily but they're nice and tender, not too crispy, with a lot of flavor! I also tried the brick toast my first time here and it was pretty good. Can't complain about a thick piece of bread covered in condensed milk, strawberries, and powered sugar. \\n\\nIt's also a really nice place to study if it's not too crowded.

Beers were $4, frozen margaritas were $6, old fashioned $6, painkiller $6, and wings were $3 (this is not everything on the happy hour menu but these are the things that we ordered). Also the venue is great, especially when the weather is nice!\\n\\nCons - However, the main entree was not so great. I went with the staff recommendation of the burger - small portion size and very very salty. I thought it was just me but we had 3 other people order it and they all said the same thing. Also, another downer is that you have to pay an extra $1.50 for cheese, which isn't the worst thing but when the burger is already $14 I would hope that the cheese would be included. Last, if you come with a large party, just know that they cannot split the tab.\\n\\nAlso, note that if you bring a birthday cake, there is an additional $20 birthday cake fee added to the tab - the manager was nice and waived the fee for us but we also would not have chosen this location if we had known that prior.\\n\\nOverall, not the best dinner experience but would come back for a happy hour. \\n\\nAttached is a picture of the burger and fries I ordered."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been here twice, once was on my birthday and another a month after. The place has a nice setting, but the service was honestly quite bad. On my birthday I got a burger, chicken biscuit, and fries. They were all okay, the burger tasting similar to something from Wendy's (which is not all that of a compliment...). The service was, again, bad. My friend did not get his food for 45 minutes until after he ordered it, during which he went up as his buzzer did not ring for a long time, the guy at the counter laughed at him and said \\"Oh, is this yours?\\" and pointed to his food then said it wasn't ready yet. When it did arrive, it [chicken strips] were burnt so much they were almost black and you could taste it. My friend was so mad that he didn't even eat them, then as after waiting all that time they were almost closing, a lady came up to us and told him that he had to leave soon when it wasn't even closed yet and that he just got his food 5 minutes before after everyone else at our table finished theirs long before.\\n\\nThe next time I went I just got a pie shake, which was $8, but I thought it would be a good portion size so I bought it anyways seeing as I was already there with some friends before we went somewhere else. Service again, was also shit. The people there barely looked at me or said anything to me while ordering and were yelling at each other. Once I got the milkshake, it was TINY. It was the size of a small/medium McDonald's shake, and tasted just like a Shari's Pie Shake of the similar type of pie, but with Shari's you get more than double what Tilt gives you and it is 2-3 dollars less.\\n\\nAnother thing! They charge you a 14% service mandatory tip for, in my opinion, quite literally no reason. Aside from the bad staff:\\na.) You have to order your food from someone at the front with no waiter/waitress.\\nb.) You have to collect your own silverware, napkins, drinks, etc.\\nc.) You do not have your food delivered to you, they give you a buzzer to tell you when it is ready, which you then go and pick up yourself.\\nd.) You also bus your own tables.\\n\\nSo please tell me, why the mandatory tip charge with your order? It makes no logical sense to me as the staff only really take your order and make it and do quite literally nothing else.\\n\\nThere is no reason for me to come here ever again, one of the very rare times I will call a place overhyped."},{"name":"Pita Pit","address":"11211 NE Fourth Plain Blvd, Ste 101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Pit PIt is surprisingly good.

I really really tried! I gave pancake social every benefit of the doubt I could on my first visit but ultimately they let me down. When we arrived the line was out the door but as they've recently switched to all counter service it was the only option so I hoped they'd be quicker than some of the other reviews I've read. Probably took ~30 minutes to get from the edge of the awning to the front of the line. It was weird that the line moved SO slowly but I chalked it up to staggering the wait for food itself - possibly the kitchen was backed up.\\n\\nI was suppressed to see how few people were in the restaurant when we did get in, it didn't seem enough to justify a major kitchen delay but the plus side is we had no trouble getting a seat. \\n\\nThe menu had a good variety, I ordered the PS burger with a fried egg and a vanilla latte. We sat outside. Our drinks were delivered within a few minutes and then it was probably another 20 or so to get our food. I was a little thrown off by a counter service place taking so long but again, new restaurant, maybe some kitchen hiccups - fine. \\n\\nWhen our food arrived I was bummed to see that the PS burger did not come with cheddar cheese as advertised on the menu, but American. Now call it personal preference but I truly can't stand American cheese and knew I wouldn't have ordered the burger had this been printed. I pointed this out to the gentleman handing out menus outside and he confirmed that the menu HAD said cheddar and went ahead to investigate for me. He came back equally disappointed that the chefs response had pretty much been  ¬Ø\\\\_(ÔøΩ?_/¬Ø and actually recommended that I not speak to the manager because I'd just be disappointed with his response. I didn't catch this servers name but I actually really appreciated his honesty - he seemed equally bummed that Pancake Social wasn't living up to its potential.\\n\\nWhen I did talk to Michael, the manager, his response was \\"oh yea I misprinted the menus this morning\\" - a pause - and then \\"anyway thanks for pointing it out!\\" And that was that. I'm not hugely picky and I'm really not that hard to please but an offer of a comped coffee on my next visit or a scone to go on the House would've really gone a long way in making it right. \\n\\nMy friends really enjoyed their avocado toast and their praline pancakes so we'll go with 2 stars. Overall I'm not gonna blacklist the place, but I'm in no rush to return. Given some time to work out the kinks, kitchen communication, food delivery speed, overall atmosphere Pancake Social could be a nice place, but don't get your hopes up that it'll be your new to go brunch spot."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for their happy hour and it was great!

I will be honest, the food here is actually pretty good. That said, I wont be spending my hard earned money here again. Every time up until last night my experience with the staff there has been pleasant. I went in at around 7 to grab a Basil Fried Rice with Chicken. This is literally the same thing I order every time I eat there. Anyway when I went into the store I was talking to a friend on the phone. I stood away from the counter for about 5 minutes, then I asked my friend to hold on one second so I could order. I ask for Basil Fried Rice with Chicken, pay for my meal, tip the cashier (apparently for incorrectly taking my order) and sat down to wait. When the food came it did not look as I was expecting. I did not have any intention of asking her to change the order, I was simply confused and thought maybe the few other times I was at the store I asked specifically for the chicken to be fried as this was grilled. Anyway I asked the cashier ¬®excuse me, is this basil fried rice?¬® ¬®You said Mango!¬®.... I responded that I asked for Basil not mango. ¬®No you said mango!\\".... ¬®maam I¬¥ve never eaten mango fried rice, did not know it was on the menu, and would not have asked for it¬® .....¬®yes you did, you were on the phone¬®  .........¬®actually I asked my friend to hold on while speaking with you so no I wasn¬¥t¬® .... ¬®yes you did, you asked for mango yes you did¬® ... Anyway, long story short she then proceeds to interrupt me as soon as I began to reply and said ¬®just give it to me!!!¬® she takes the container to the back and another worker returns shortly thereafter with a basil fried rice without chicken -_- .... anyway at this point Im over it and just take my twice wrong order home. I give it to a roommate who I told the story to so he knew of the chances something off menu may have found its way into the meal. \\n\\nAnyway as I stated it wasnt my intention to exchange the meal. I find it troublesome that common decency when communicating with customers seems to be lost on certain people. Rather than contemplate the fact that maybe you heard ¬®mango¬® when I said ¬®basil¬® you would rather imagine that I ordered something I never heard of nor knew was on the menu. Its the small things that go a long way with customers, simply speaking to them as a person rather than the opposition would be a nice start. If you cant have a conversation without being rude, snatching items from customers, etc maybe you should find employment outside the service industry. \\n\\nIt sucks that one person ruined this place for me, like I said earlier the food is good but other areas are lacking.

Sometimes it gets noisy when larger crowds come in but that's natural. I love the quality of their boba. All boba is soaked in honey and gives it an amazing sweetness, and the texture of the boba is not chalky, pruney, or grainy like some other places. My favorite items on the menu are the sea salt thai tea with boba, milk tea with boba, and the basil fried chicken!"},{"name":"Tea Haus","address":"10815 Ranch Road 2222, Ste 207","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I can't believe I just discovered this gem in Austin. I love the interior design- especially the wall with the iconic quote. It's a great place for pictures and it definitely leaves an impression.\\n\\nI ordered a milk tea with boba and also the strawberry brick toast. The milk tea came out in 2 minutes and the strawberry brick toast came out in 10. The milk tea was really good- more on the tea-tasting side and less sugary. The strawberry brick toast was amazing and made me realize the toast trend wasn't just a strange fad with no substance. The presentation was picture-worthy for it. \\n\\nAll in all, I will be coming back here again to try other drinks and dishes! Wish this place was closer to downtown Austin so I could stop by more frequently. :)"},{"name":"China Garden","address":"1579 Monroe Dr NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I don't know why so many are bashing this place?!

The saffron ice cream was unusual and tasty. I feel like frozen yogurt is a bit of a rip off, because you don't know what you're paying until you weigh your concoction at the register. Would not go out of my way to return, though, as frozen yogurt goes, it was fine and the staff was friendly. Saffron froyo was interesting.

I ordered Ginger Chicken which is supposed to have steamed broccoli in it and the broccoli was raw, not underdone but completely raw and cold. This happens often here. I also ordered Pad Thai and it had strings of egg that was fried to a crisp all through it so you would keep biting down on hard pieces that couldn't be chewed. They put a handful of 3 inch pieces of scallion in it instead of bite-sized slices. So very unpleasant meal. This place is not cheap and even then you would expect decent quality. I come here because of the gluten-free options for some family members. I stay away for a few months after a bad experience. The food quality is not consistent.

We got a Reuben sandwich & open face seitan sandwich which were also pretty good. If you're vegan make sure to get the Reuben w/out the cheese. Their desserts are also delicious & smaller portion so don't share, just get your own. The service could've been better although everyone was super friendly.

Met up with some friends here for my first visit, and I was impressed.  It's just not an easy sell even in Portland to do vegan and gluten free, but they make everything shine here.  Great staff who are glad to answer questions, super clean cafe, and just a great atmosphere.  Almost an upscale 1950's feel to it.\\n\\nIt was a hard choice, so many great options, but I went with a piece of lemon cake with a lime frosting.  Very nicely decorated on a big plate, the huge piece of cake was a winner.  At first I thought, this better be something for $8, and while everything seems to be a little pricey, you have to remember you are in a specialty shop paying for specially made items that cost a lot to make and a lot of time to prepare.  Turns out I wouldn't have had a clue my cake was gluten free, let alone vegan.  So freaking good!\\n\\nThe cafe serves up some dinner meals as well as baked goods and ice creams.  My friends had a lasagna and macaroni and cheese, and another friend had a really enticing ice cream sundae.  We were all left very happy with our choices.
