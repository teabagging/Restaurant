There's no denying it, no matter how much crap my friends give me because of it.  Southern food is hearty, flavorful, not vegan or gluten-free.  As Julia Child once said, \\"the only time to eat diet food is while you're waiting for the steak to cook.\\"  Still, whenever I travel to visit a friend, he or she invariably suggests southern food...and I love it.\\n\\nSo, Screen Door it is.  We showed up at about 5:30 on Sunday evening and it was HAILING outside.  Clearly, people were unfazed by the mother nature's cruel joke, because the line didn't get any shorter.  People were real troopers.  By the time we got inside, they told us the wait was going to be 45 min.  \\"If you're not here, you'll get skipped,\\" the host warned us sternly.  Oh well.  A bar next door it is.\\n\\nSide note: 45-minute wait makes one's expectations exponentially higher.\\n\\nAfter waiting an appropriate amount of time, we were seated in a very quiet booth away from the door and the bar.  Bonus!  We started with 2 flights of whiskey, just to try all of their 6 offerings.  I am just going to say it: starting your meal 3 shots of whiskey is a great idea.  $22 well spent.\\n\\nAs my friend and I were looking at the menu, we noticed that EVERYTHING sounded amazing.  As we were trying to zero in on a few items, we took turns saying \\"but I also want to try that!\\"  Sometimes choices are tough.\\n\\nWe started with the gumbo, the fried okra and the hush puppies.  The gumbo was thick, flavorful and hearty.  The okra was OK, but the hush puppies were AMAZING.  They were easily the best hush puppies I've had NOT in the South.\\n\\nWe shared two entrees: the pork shoulder and the screen door plate, which is a plate of sides.  Oh, and we ordered the grits, too.  The cauliflower dish was flavorful and surprisingly NOT boring.  The mac 'n' cheese was divine - I could have easily had 2 bowls by myself.  The pork shoulder, sadly, was a bit dry, as was the cornbread.  The grits were very good, but word of warning: eat them fast or they will turn into stale cream of wheat.\\n\\nI cannot wait to come back here and try the chicken and the brisket, which everyone seems to love.

Going to two Texas BBQ institutions that their reputation precedes them. I had gone to the original Salt Lick the night prior to going to Franklins and their brisket was just ok and not worth the hour drive from Austin. \\n\\nEnough of the complaining about the \\"other guys\\". I love watching BBQ pit masters and watching Aaron Franklin on TV. Just his descriptions and his awards really made me want to taste his food. I was done with work at 1 and decided to shoot over there and do my best to get some scraps as I knew I was cutting it close to when they run out. I waited about 1.5hrs on line and while I did two nice employees came out asking if we needed beverages while we waited and to explain to us that we were passed the guaranteed food mark and that we may not get what we want or anything at all and that we wait at our own expense. Very courteous and setting expectations up front. Once you step into the building it takes about 25 minutes to order. They only have one guy taking the order for the meets you'll like and another for sides/toppings. Just as I was about to order the woman in front of me took the last sausage! Damn! But there was a whole lot of Brisket left! I guess I looked quite upset when I was told no more sausage so they gave me 1/4-1/2lb of pulled pork on the house(much appreciated) and I ordered a pound of lean brisket. \\n\\nBeef! I've been to many many maaaany BBQ joints and none come close to Franklins. The salty/pepper bark was delicious. If you aren't a fan of peppery brisket well then you'll just have to have the pulled pork, omg I don't even like pork and I could see myself eating a pound of that as well. Back to the brisket(sorry this place has got me going crazy). You really do not need a knife to eat your brisket. It's got the perfect pull to the meat and falls apart, not because it was overly cooked and dried out, but the opposite. It was cooked perfectly and the fat rendered down and the beef was extremely moist! The fat cap was still intact on the lean brisket and easily pulled off if that's not your thing. Between, moisture, texture and flavor there really wasn't a need for the sauces. \\n\\nI sampled the 3 sauces and they were all delicious. The thin vinegary sauce I used a little on the pulled pork and it went very well! And once again not needed on the pork either but still great. Then there were two other sauces; think brown sauce and a less viscous sauce I tried on my brisket. If I had to pick one of the non vinegar sauces I'd pick the red BBQ sauce over the brown one. \\n\\nI also don't normally like coleslaw or as Texans call it, slaw because I'm not a mayo lover. But while I was here I figured I'd try it. OMG! They have converted me into a coleslaw lover! Best I've ever had. Not sure if there was any mayo in it at all and if there was its very little.

The first time it was a good experience was when I went with a business pal who eats at Aria often. He explained to me beforehand that they treat him very well, and they know him- and they did, we got thrown some extra courses from the chef.  A few months later I brought serious clients to this establishment. We came in without reservations, and were treated like this restaurant was some sort of vip dining zone. It seemed that we completely ruined the bartenders day, after we quietly walked in during business hours.... I know from going out to eat often that restaurants can use a little extra business around 5:00. Sorry. The food was decent but the service was a joke. The waiter would be gone for 5 minute intervals, and nobody would be around us. When the waiter came out he was trying to swallow his last bit of food! I write this because it is upsetting when you take clients out and they are distracted by service concerns. The check took forever to pay and there was one other table in the restaurant. The second chance I gave to Aria was also poor. We waited FOREVER for our table, my partner had made the reservation and was frustrated. I could smell alcohol on the matre de who I assume was the manager. They did give us bread, which was good bread; but frozen butter. Our table agreed the waiter was either intoxicated; or having a bad night. Our 1st course never came and our salads were given to the wrong people and they just walked away, but they were good salads. My partner got the wrong dish but the waiter insisted we ordered it.

There are bar snacks, a selection of about 5 draft beers, large cocktail menu and a few mocktails.

I'd never had anything cooked sous vide so I went for it with the request it be brought up from medium rare to medium. The lamb arrived and while it looked delicious, did not taste well. The entire cut had a thick layer of inedible fat along the top and had the outside had been charred, making it inedible as well. By the end of the meal, I felt that half of the lamb was half chewed in my napkin. Here's where you may be asking \\"why didn't you say something?\\" and I agree, I should've said something, but like I said, it was our anniversary and I didn't want to mar the occasion. The real shock however, came when we got the ticket. Not only did the lamb cost $37 (about $35 more than it was worth), but it was labeled as \\"V-DAY LAMB\\". We were there on the 20th. I understand they were trying to push the lamb out before it went bad, but at least change the name in your POS. \\n\\nIn addition, the service was overbearing (our server interrupted a toast) and the host left a snooty message on my phone wondering why I hadn't showed up for my reservation (I had).

What happened?  :(\\n\\nI had been a faithful and steady customer of the Border Cafe for over 10 years.  Unfortunately, things have taken a serious turn for the worse over the past few years - did they change ownership or something??  They have cheapened all I considered to be their greatest assets!  Namely, they took the Cadillac Fajitas off the menu.  WHY?   MAJOR disappointment.  It was a great cut of filet, and never disappointed.  I asked the manager to substitute the Jim Bowie dish filet for the regular beef fajitas and he refused saying they hadn't been happy with the cuts of filet they'd been getting.  So I said...ok, but you still are selling it in the other dish??  Blank stare...I said, forget it. Regular beef fajitas were subpar that night, at best.  I tried it again tonight. It was SO peppery, I couldn't taste anything else.  Also, for the fajitas they ASKED if I wanted peppers?  It used to be automatic that you got one red pepper on top of the onions, etc. for a nice look.  This meal was not good.  I guess it's pretty cheap though, so you really do get what you pay for.  Seemed they changed the chips too (they were thicker and not nearly as good as they used to be).  It's like they poured bagged chips into the warmer and filled up the baskets.  I'm sure they used to make them there?!  Not anymore, unless we were given a couple day old batch.  I added 1 star for the service.  The servers are typically friendly, and the service is fast.  Bottom line - I don't know why they changed anything...why fix it if it ain't broke?  Well, now it's broken and I won't be back until it's repaired!

I ordered the Rami's special ($17) which had grilled chicken, shwarma, falafel, hummus, pita and veggies (cabbage, lettuce, pickles, cukes and tomatoes).  The food took about 10 minutes to be ready.  There's no table service, you order at the counter and pick up your food.  Every one's food came out in a minute or two so it was a bit awkward to wait about 10 minutes watching everyone eat and then make everyone wait a good 20 minutes after they eat so I could finish.  We also had to clean off our table from the last group since staff wasn't getting around to it.  The food wasn't bad.  The shwarma was good if a little salty, I wasn't particularly pleased with the grilled chicken which had a little too much fat/gristle for my taste.  The falafel wasn't bad.  The six little falafel balls were pretty good and had a good texture (slightly crispy shell and soft inside).  The veggies were fine and I liked the hummus.  The pita bread was good.  I like mine thick and fluffy which it is at Rami's.  I ate my entire plate and was still hungry.  I probably would've liked more food from the Rami's special but maybe I just eat too much.\\n\\nAside from the food taking a while to be ready, the service was a bit hard to understand and we had some trouble communicating.

I wish i could give this place more than 5 stars because it was just so frickin' good. They also sell breakfast all-day long so that is awesome in itself too. For dessert, I HAD to try the Vanilla Bean Bourbon Bacon Moon Pie, as seen on Diners Drive Ins and Dives, and it was to die for. As Guy said \\"Its legit.\\" I couldn't agree more!

Mighty Cone is simple and delicious. Chicken, shrimp, avocado or all 3, with ancho sauce and mango coleslaw, in a tortilla placed inside a snowcone cup for ease and safekeeping. The batter on the main ingredients is very tasty- a very very slight sweetness, a mellow salt content and a great crunch. It's a blend of sesame seeds, cornflakes, and like 2-3 other things I don't remember. But it's delicious! I had the shrimp cone and my husband had the chicken, both were really pretty dang good. The only thing that sucked is that my food didn't stay in the tortilla, it fell down into the cup. No biggie since I had a fork but I would've loved for it to stay in the tortilla since that was kinda the point, lol. Oh well.

When it comes to pairing Southern cuisine and Sunday Brunch, there's no doubt that South City Kitchen in Midtown can compete with the best of 'em.

They didn't go overboard with the hollandaise, the shreds of beef were tender and flavorful, and the eggs were perfectly poached.  The fried chicken was as good as all of the hype surrounding it suggests.  The waffles were far more light and airy than the more dense waffles I was used to - which is a good thing.  Though I've never been a fan of grits, these were actually pretty decent.  \\n\\nThe service was good, the prices were reasonable and I left happy and stuffed.

There was no better time than this weekend, as I heard that they were closing soon for the winter. I had also heard from an associate that they had the best falafel in town. Now THAT is a bold statement, especially since I have very high standards for falafel (I still have dreams of Amsterdam Falafel Shop in DC). But after trying their falafel, I can understand such a perspective. The falafel balls had great flavor and texture, and they meshed excellently with the fresh, warm pita. The hummus and veggies that were included were also very tasty, and the green hot sauce condiment was a great addition. The only thing that was missing from the falafel was tzatziki sauce, but it was understandably absent in trying to make this a purely vegan dish. I also appreciated the picked veggies that came with the falafel, as they were a nice touch. Finally, I also enjoyed the tasty Tea-un-ade (aka Arnold Palmer, as my buddy pointed out), which was a refreshing complement to the meal. Overall, the meal certainly satisfied my falafel fix and everything tasted very fresh. To say that it is the best falafel in town? So far, I can agree to that. That said, I have had better falafel outside of Portland. However, until I can find a place here in town that that can trump Wolf N' Bear's, I will certainly swing by there again when they reopen for their solid falafel and more."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"meh.\\n\\nReviewing solely the food, this is fairly standard BBQ.

The overall experience was okay, but not quite what I was hoping for. Before planning our trip to La Urbana, I emailed the restaurant to see if they had any vegan or at least vegetarian options. I had looked at their menu and was having a hard time determining so I contacted them. I received a response right away and was advised that they do have several veggie options and will do their best to accommodate any requests. I also asked if their beans contain lard and was advised that they do not. I was disappointed to learn from my server at dinner that their beans contain chicken stock... It was a bit frustrating because I would have thought that the person I was emailing with would recognize to tell me that when I was inquiring specifically about the beans being vegetarian friendly. Either way, I guess I should not assume...?\\n\\nLa Urbana was on my list of places to try based solely on the fact that they are a Mezcal bar. I have been obsessed with Mezcal since I learned about it at Paper Plane in Decatur and I was excited to explore it more. I didn't really get to do that here. La Urbana's drink menu consists of a selection of tequila based drinks and a selection of mezcal based drinks. There wasn't a list of their mezcal or tequila brands, no mezcal flights, etc. I was hoping for more emphasis on this since they are a \\"tequila and mezcal bar\\". When I asked the server for info about their mezcals she said she could write them down for me. Meh.\\n\\nThe food was more impressive than the drinks.  We ordered the guacamole as a starter. It was served with cheese chips.. kind of untraditional, which I like. I asked for regular chips but did try the cheese chips. Pretty tasty! I ordered the taco plate, minus the \\"chicken beans\\". Instead, I received a double scoop of their rice. The rice was good and flavorful. I ordered the \\"aquacate\\" tacos. They were made with tempura fried avocado. They were good, but not amazing .

Our bartender, Olivia, was excellent - which can make all the difference in your experience.  She was quick (minded & moving) and observant.    My husband had a few patron margaritas $8.50, he said they were nothing special but still very good (the glass wasn't half full of sour mix) and I had a couple of John Dalys ($8.50) which is my new favorite drink.

We all chose the fried rice also. The showmanship of the chef was pretty good and we had fun. I thought the food was prepared a little out of order. The appetizer shrimp was prepared after the main meat. I didn't mind though.  The food was ok. The shrimp and lobster were a little dry. I chose my steak as rare and it same out nicely.

And while I have a hard time with bacon and the barbacoa option at Chipotle, I'm eating a mostly meat-free diet these days, too. So we started coming to Papa G's back in the raw food era, and while it's not as much of a staple as it was then, we still both find things we enjoy.\\n\\nNamely, as Robyn A mentioned, because there aren't as many raw options as I think there could be. But there's usually a pesto salad and other entree selections. And that's not as much of a deal breaker these days. But the other all-vegetarian (and often gluten-free, too, if that's your jam) dishes in the front counter can be really good. There are also a lot of sandwich options as well as a salad bar, but it's the special rotating items in the counter that really get me excited. I tried the tofu coconut curry with steamed greens and sweet potato smash, and holla. Man, I love me some curry. I don't know that I've eaten anything but that save for once when I got something beige, probably around last Thanksgiving. \\n\\nThe storefront probably won't change the minds of anyone who thinks that veggie-friendly automatically means shabby hippie.

Typically if one is looking for such a game, he or she is required to travel pretty far or play in real dives. Ace of Spades is not perfect, but provides an overall good playing experience. The dealers initially surprised me with their skill, but I have now become accustomed to very good dealers here. The place is well lit with usually good music playing and several large-screen TV's playing sporting events. It also has an inviting atmosphere for people playing for the first time.\\n\\nThe one criticism I have of the place is that management seems to allow some regulars to get away with certain behavior that makes me (and others I have spoken with) uncomfortable. A few players frequently throw out gay slurs, make sexual comments to the female waitstaff, and the bullying against some regulars by other regulars is downright cruel. I was told this month that new management is to begin this week and will be addressing some of this behavior to class it up a bit. I hope this occurs.\\n\\nDespite a few of the players leaving a lot to be desired, the vast majority of the people that play here are great to play with; the dealers are fast and professional; the hired managers have uniformly been very cool to play and deal with; and the atmosphere for poker cannot be beat in the Portland metropolitan area. I will continue to play here regularly, and am very grateful that a real poker room has come to southwest Portland.\\n\\nUpdate (1/20/13): As alluded to in my original post, new management has taken over the place, and the changes I had hoped for were put in place. I now give Ace of Spades a strong five stars. The negative behaviors that bothered me before (e.g., bullying) have been dealt with swiftly and effectively. I have now been to Ace of Spades several times since its reopening under new management and all of my concerns have been addressed.\\n\\nThere have also been changes made that I did not anticipate, and they have all been positive. The tables are now much larger and more comfortable. All aspects of the interior were given a facelift. The bathrooms, which had been a problem, are now refurbished and reliably clean.

The menu is New Orleans southern style tapas. We ordered the Gouda mac and cheese, BBQ shrimp and beef sliders.

I went for the first time on Tuesday (12/30/14) for Lunch...went again on Friday for dinner (1/2/14)...and returned on Sunday (1/4/15) for lunch.\\n\\nBy far my favorite ramen is the Ol' Skool style ramen served at Lunch. That's how I remember it growing up in Hawaii and when in Japan. The broth is just right never too salty, and I prefer the slightly thicker noodles than those at dinner.\\n\\nThe absolutely star outside of the Ramen and Ramen broth however is the Chashu! If you go you MUST get extra Chashu and try a Chashu Bowl. The pork just melts in your mouth, and the char is just heaven.\\n\\nIf you go closer to opening time, the line is pretty quick, but anything in between and towards the end just be prepared to wait, but please know it's WORTH THE WAIT. Once you've placed your order and take a seat, the food comes out pretty fast and furiously. The staff is friendly. If there was anything to critique it would be the frequency of the servers checking on you, but it's also understandable as they are truly THAT busy. This is not a eat your food and hang out for a while spot. Once you place your order and sit down, your food is usually to you within 5 minutes.\\n\\nSo I 100% recommend going here, and I CANNOT wait for the South Austin location....because I live south! :)"},{"name":"Soul Fire BBQ","address":"182 Harvard Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"I have ordered from Soul Fire many times, usually through grub hub.

When we said no, she sat us near the kitchen and said that table was reserved for a party of 6.  Another couple came in after us and sat in that same table...ARGH...My wife did not notice thank God or all hell would have broke loose.  So we are finally greeted by our server and asked for a menu. No menus here she said in a condescending tone. Our server started with the attitude and rattled off a few items  (I knew what I wanted...baked haddock, raviolis and meatballs)  and when I told our server she said that was an unusual combination...hence MORE attitude.  i saw them pumping out appetizers from the kitchen and if I had known, would have ordered appetizers.  Money is not an issue as we dine out frequently.  She brought out our food and neglected to ask if everything was OK until I was halfway through my meal.  I then had to ask her for grated cheese...She forgot to bring my meatballs.  i had them for dessert LOL Anyhow the bill came to 80 bucks for 2 entrees, I don't care about that but I will NEVER go back.

I wanted to try a breakfast taco but I guess they only serve them during breakfast times except on the weekend.  So that was a bust.  I love breakfast tacos at all times of the day EVERY day!

I am from San Jose and 45 min is like a blip compared to the some of the more popular restaurants (try two hours AND with a crying baby!).\\n\\nI expected to find all of Portland's east side here but there it was a melting pot of all ethnicities and that to me is a very good sign this place will leave me smiling and satisfied.\\n\\nThey have free self serve coffee which I didn't know about till after I walked back from Starbucks (3 blocks away) while waiting for our table.  Seating in the waiting area is pretty limited so be prepared to bring an umbrella if it rains and a jacket if it's super cold.\\n\\nBefore we even sat down we were drooling at all the huge servings being dished out by the waiters.  That's torture if you haven't eaten breakfast.  Once we did get seated my wife and I decided to share the chicken and waffles.  Yes, I said the word share.  From my experience gorging on good food, well, it doesn't really end up as good memories if you try to stuff yourself.  We both reason that we were still hungry we would order some more.  \\n\\nOur chicken and waffle surprisingly took a while to arrive at my fingertips but boy was it worth the wait!  To give you some background on my \\"chicken and waffle\\" experiences, I've been all over the place including the famous Roscoe's in SoCal.  Well, I am happy to say that this place makes Roscoe's taste like KFC!  I was actually looking for wings or drumsticks but surprisingly they used boneless breast meat.  I was really skeptical because it's very hard to get white meat moist especially the breast part.  To my surprise, it was extremely moist as if somehow they injected chicken broth into the chicken before frying.  It's that moist!  I usually HATE breast meat (dark meat kinda dude) but I kept tearing and tearing at it hoping to find a dry piece.  And just like in Powerball -  no luck at all!   \\n\\nHow about the batter?  Well, I am getting to that!  The batter outside was as perfect as can be.  No burnt, over fried areas, or too much batter on one side and not enough on the other kinda deal!  In addition, the chicken meat itself has got some kick to it.!  My wife's theory is that they must brine their chicken with the spices.  She says this because you can literally taste the spices inside the meat even if the batter is removed.  Well, whatever it is whether they raise magical chicken with spicy genes, it's hella flavorful.  \\n\\nAnd the waffles?  They are to die for.  I was told the waffles are sweet potato based.  Yes, they were amazingly good and didn't taste like the run of the mill waffles you would find at every chicken and waffle place.  Definitely a plus for flavor originality.  \\n\\nWe were given three pieces of chicken breast and one good size waffle.  I finished two pieces of chicken and a quarter of the waffle while my wife finished 3/4 of her chicken piece and a quarter of her waffle.  Yes, we were stuffed but not to the point where we didn't enjoy it.  I am glad we shared and will try another dish the next time we are here.  We were with another couple and they ordered biscuits and gravy in addition to the chicken and waffles and they regretted it.  Unless you are a hot dog eating champion, I recommend you don't let your eyes take over your stomach.\\n\\nAs personal tip, I recommend the gravy on the side (without the biscuits).  It's the meatiest gravy I've ever eaten and goes well with the fried chicken as a dipping sauce.  Finger sucking good!!\\n\\nBy the way, our waitress was extremely polite, courteous, prompt, and most importantly always had a smile on her face.  Well worth the trip and the wait!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"On a food tour I had the pleasure of trying the sausage, turkey and the beloved brisket from Franklin's.

Was this the best brisket ever and was my life forever changed? I would say no but it is among some of the best. I also tried two of their BBQ sauces, the first was a simple watery BBQ sauce and the espresso sauce.  The first one was perfect as it had a light enough flavor not to take away from the flavor of the meat. I loved the espresso sauce with its smokey sweetness.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"It shore is purty. But No Mas, didn't your mama tell you that true beauty is on the INSIDE? *sigh*\\n\\nIt would be unfair of me not to state one major caveat regarding my No Mas experience. The one time I went was following the Castleberry Hill Art Stroll. The restaurant had been especially busy that night and our group of six showed up just prior to closing. They weren't even going to seat us, but then they decided to invite us in, so we were essentially one of the last tables before the kitchen closed.\\n\\nHonestly, they should have just called it a night.\\n\\nSomeone immediately brought chips and salsa, which I saw as a good sign. Until I picked up my first chip (super thin with visible grease, very little flavor, needed salt) and dipped it into the, um, \\"salsa.\\" My dining companions did the same, and as we chewed, we all looked at each other quizzically, until someone blurted out, \\"it tastes like KETCHUP!\\"  What it really tasted like was canned crushed tomatoes. An inquiry to our server informed us that they had run out of their normal salsa. The fact that they tried to pass canned tomatoes off as salsa put them at an immediate disadvantage in the credibility/authenticity department. Any restaurant owner/manager who cared about its customers and reputation would not have tried to pull that off.\\n\\nMy margarita was $7.50, it came in a pint glass. It was fine, but not memorable. Better than sour-mix-heavy swill from the \\"cheap mexican\\" places but nowhere near, say, Agave quality. My friend ordered guacamole. It was quite good (though it did seem like they used chopped lettuce or something to \\"stretch\\" it), and I'm a guac snob...it earned them the extra star. A couple of us ordered chicken quesadillas. The ingredients tasted fresh and the quesadilla is huge (good thing, since it ends up being almost $11 when you add the meat). But, it wasn't actually GRILLED like a quesadilla should be. The tortillas were soft, and I think they may have actually microwaved them. Another person at my table said his food was room temperature.\\n\\nService was fine, efficient. But it definitely had that, I-took-this-last-table-just-to-make-sure-I-made-money-tonight feeling. And he added an 18% grat to our table...he's got to make money, that's why he's there, and nothing that was wrong was his fault.

Since I moved to Boston I have been hard pressed to find a great Mexican restaurant that has all my favorites.  Although the Border cafe is technically Tex-Mex, they still have classic Mexican dishes like enchiladas.  In my opinion, no other Mexican restaurant in Boston gets it quite right.  In addition to having great food, they serve endless chips and salsa, and have great margaritas on the rocks or blended.  To top it all off, this is some of the most affordable food in Boston.  Without alcohol, two can eat for under $20 and with alcohol, about $20-$30.  Great food, drinks, and atmosphere. Good for kids and groups.  I guess the only con I could point out would be that it does get pretty loud upstairs and the servers are always really busy, but still attentive enough.

Our first visit was well over a decade ago, and all we can really remember about it was it was expensive.  Not that we are a little harder to impress, we decided to put Ruth's to the test.  We booked a reservation for Valentine's Day, and as such I was expecting the place to be packed.  Ruth's was obviously expecting a big crowd, because they sat us in a part of the dining area that is not usually used.  It was secluded in one of the corners.  We were originally a little miffed at being put in the corner, but it turned out to be pretty nice since we were on a date.  Ruth's was quiet and clean.  There were spotless linens on the tables and spotless glassware and plates on those spotless linens.  The only reason Ruth's Steak House did not score an A+ was that the d√©cor was slightly bland.  An hour after we left we couldn't tell you any details about the d√©cor, so it wasn't very memorable.\\n\\nService:  Grade B:  Our server, Jessica, did a fantastic job making sure all of our wants and needs were met.  Wait time for appetizers and entrees was what you would expect for this type of dining experienced.  We didn't feel rushed, nor did we feel like we were waiting an excessive amount of time for food.  There were no mistakes made with our order.  The service was extremely professional and efficient.  Normally, this type of service would earn at least an A-/B+ grade.  However, in this case we found nothing really engaging about the service.  We did not feel engaged, which isn't a huge deal except that when you go to Ruth's Chris, you know you're going to drop some serious coin.  So our expectations for phenomenal service are really high.\\n\\nFood/Spirits:  Grade A-:   Ruth's Chris was so close to scoring an A or A+ in this category - real close.  Katina started off with a couple of Blueberry Mojitos and I enjoyed a couple of Thirsty Dog Cerberus ales.  The beer selection was golden and malty, with a slight oaky/bourbon note and some vanilla undertones.  Katina's Blueberry Mojito was sweet and sugary, with virtually no alcohol bite to it.  It was a very well-mixed cocktail.  For an appetizer, we ordered the spicy lobster.  This dish consisted of bite-sized portions of lobster lightly breaded and tossed in a sweet and spicy glace.  I think Katina and I had simultaneous mouthgasms.  We are big fans of the Bang Bang Shrimp at Bonefish Grill.  The spicy lobster at Ruth's Chris was like Bang Bang Shrimp on steroids...fantastic.  For entrees, Katina ordered the Crab cakes and I selected a NY Strip.  We split an order of Lobster Mac and Cheese for our side dish.  The Lobster Mac and Cheese had a nice crust and was slightly creamy.  It wasn't quite as good as the lobster mac and cheese at Eddie Merlot's, but Ruth's Chris version was still pretty delicious.  Katina's crab cakes were bigger than expected.  They were packed with crab meat and had a distinct crabby flavor.  In addition, the crab cakes absorbed the butter sauce they were served with, which further enhanced the flavor.  My NY strip arrived on a heated plate and immediately got me drooling.  I ordered the steak prepared medium well, and the version I received was definitely more on the medium end of the spectrum, but that was okay.  The steak was expertly seasoned.  BUT, I had originally wanted to order the lamb chops, but was told by our server that they were out of lamb since the shipment they had just received did not live up to Ruth's Chris standards.  That's fine, but that means that my second choice had better be a spectacular chunk of meat.  The first half of the steak tasted just a juicy and tender as it looked, but the second half of the steak had a ribbon of gristle running horizontally through the meat.  You couldn't eat around it because of how it was situated in the steak.  I was a little disappointed that this piece of meat lived up to their standards but the lamb chops were tossed out.\\n\\nValue:  Grade C:   We give this category the lowest weight when we calculate the overall grade for a restaurant.  Unless you've been living in a box (or a van down by the river), you should be aware that Ruth's Chris is not a place to visit if you're concerned about spending some coin.  We entered Ruth's Chris with the expectation of leaving a couple hundred dollars poorer, but we also expected our taste buds to experience an hour of ecstasy.   Ruth's Chris came pretty close, but fell a little short"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Always delicious.  Noisy (but fun).

After a 30 minute wait we were seated inside at a small table.

Moist and impeccably seasoned. I can be a Chatty Cathy but I ate in complete silence.  5) The sides are great. The collards were yummy and the fries were satisfyingly crunchy and well-seasoned. 6) Price is moderate-- a bit expensive for BBQ but the portions are so large and the food delicious that  I would pay even more than that.  The only thing I didn't care for was the white bbq sauce. I think it's mayonnaise based. It comes with your food so you might as well try it.

So we never came back to this location to eat inside lol and nowhere else did that so we thought it was just this place. But I am reviewing their drive thru breakfast tacos because we get it a lot here to go early in the morning for church and for ourselves. ITs really good. Simple and good. Yes can not compare to the non-chain really authentic ones especially from a trailer but these will do and much cheaper especially if you buy the assorted pack. They are yummy, hot and fresh and we love their sofest tortillas. Their sauces are great too. We'd love more filling in them though but for the price, it is ok. Just have to eat two :) Its not too buttery like Rudy's and done just right. So if you need a quick breakfast to go, I'd head here. Not the healthiest or prettiest but fast and delicious :) This location is convenient too because its right of a main freeway albeit some weird maneuvering in the parking lot but in and out right there! If you dine in or to go-we recommend their Supreme nachos and beef fajitas. That's what we always get for our huge family and its so good when you can load up their salsas. Always loved their soft tortillas :)"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The only problem I had with this place was that it was so crowded it was impossible to sit comfortably.

And they used the wrong cheese. bartender was totally on it and went back to get the right one. the re fire unfortunately took just as long. bartender apologized and said don't worry you're not even paying for it when it does come. finally got it and devoured it. shit happens, i work in the industry, i was just glad to get my burger. other times i've dined in food/service is awesome. even their salads are good...which is saying something for a burger joint. keep an eye out for their burger of the day. usually some last minute creation. some are intriguing. others are not. always worth checking out though if you want something more exotic than what's on their menu. Take out window service is awesome. there's an order and a pick up window. person at the order window is always friendly. i usually make the jerk mistake of putting my burger order in, add LTO...then remember oh, sub a turkey patty. i guess the way their system is set up...if you're modifying the patty (veggie, turkey, extra, etc) you need to do that first. felt like a total jerk making the girl start over but she was like \\"no no prob at all\\" and had it done in 10 seconds. \\n\\ncalling in orders...hmph. one time they forgot a burger. huge fail as it was family dinner night back at moms and someone didn't have a burger ended up calling a place that delivered and more in the neighborhood. FAIL. although i did tell my brother he should have counted the burgers since it was a big order. called and the mgr said i could come back the next day and get it ...never got around to it. kinda wish he gave me some sort of credit or gift card..idk. \\na more recent call in order was flawless though. the person on the phone even repeated the order back and gave me a total (money and also like, okay so that's 5 burgers total). maybe they started doing this because burgers were missing more than once? but when my dad came home with the bags of burgers and fries everything was accounted for. faith was restored for calling in orders. Pricing is super reasonable. I prefer this place over UBurger. but not over 5 guys. Sorry, i just love five guys' fries. Also all of 5 guys toppings are free so that's kind of a no brainer. but if you're in the neighborhood head over to tasty burger and that's just what you'll get!!

The chicken and waffles stack is a towering skyscraper of chicken on a large sweet potato waffle. If you're there with a group and anybody's on their first visit, someone should definitely get a plate of the chicken and share; you'll probably still have leftovers.\\n\\nThere's some Items that don't get enough love. The Heuvos Rancheros is an amazing mix of rice, beans, eggs, house salsa, and this rioja-braised brisket that comes out fork tender and amazing. The dish is served piping hot, and I'd say it's definitely my 2nd favorite.\\n\\nThe specials change week by week, and the breakfast hash (normally smoked brisket & veggie) change in what vegetables they use, so that can add some variety if you end up going there frequently. All of the benedicts are great too. If they have a special steak benedict, always get that. If not, you can't go wrong with the oyster benedict.\\n\\nAs for brunch drinks, they are all great. The Bloody Mary mix they make is amazing. The Ramos Gin Fizz tastes like neapolitan ice cream in booze form.

Rami's gave me my very first taste of falafel when I was a teenager and I have been hooked on the stuff ever since. I can still remember the glory of their fried-to-order falafel, the creaminess of their hummus and the freshness of their cucumber, tomato and red cabbage toppings. I can't recall the number of warm summer days when my friends and I have taken their sandwiches to go and sat on the lawn of the Devotion school across the street happily chowing away.\\n\\nThe thing about a good falafel sandwich is that it is more than the sum of its ingredients- it's a synergy of spices, vegetables, chickpeas, and pita that come together to create something sublime. The results can be either stunning or barely mediocre. I can't recall exactly when it happened, but for at least half a year now Rami's sandwiches have shifted sadly into the mediocre category. The freshness and quality of the ingredients has diminished, the falafel are rarely fried-to-order anymore, and everything has the faint and troubling flavor of school cafeteria food. Sad.\\n\\nNow let's talk a little bit about the price. There was a time when Rami's was a cheap dining option. I accepted the sharp increase in their prices because of the fact that their food was so good, but to pay upwards of eight dollars for the mediocrity that Rami's has become is unconscionable. Loathe as I am to make Boston vs. New York comparisons, cheap and delicious falafel is one category which New York far exceeds. Most Boston falafel shops seem to grossly overcharge for something so cheap to make. Perhaps in New York the sheer volume of falafel sold allows restaurants to charge lower prices, but I still don't believe Rami's has any justification in charging $7.95 for it other than the fact that their Coolidge Corner location let's them get away with it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Rami's would be a halfway decent falafel shop and one I might have a higher opinion of it were it not for the fact that it was once so much better."},{"name":"La Mezcaleria","address":"1622 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Rodrigo's overall rating: 9/10 because getting to try everyone else's meals made up for what mine lacked\\n\\nJulie's overall rating: 9/10 I could have cried, but the chilaquiles didn't even need salt.\\n\\nread our full review here:\\nhttp://barrerasforbrunch.tumblr.com/post/134205747973/b-is-for-brunch-so-decadent-i-could-have-cried"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Thank you so much for offering to take my money for your wonderful ramen!

My friends and I (a party of 4) arrived around 9:40 PM. Typically I wouldn't come to a restaurant so close to closing, but we were starving. Normally when you're approaching the end of the night for a restaurant, you feel as if you're being swept out and rushed. This was not the case at all. Our sever Adam took amazing care of us. The fresh cornbread they offer was amazing. I also had the rum punch (two in fact). It was a well put together drink. I could taste every ingredient. As an entree three of us ordered the fried chicken dinner. We were all very happy. I am hard to please but every aspect of it was super yummy. The chicken was crispy and well seasoned as if it were brined. The mashed potatoes were freshly mashed with Bits of the skins mixed in. The collard greens seemed to be lacking a bit of salt, but I can understand that was just a personal preference, and it is probably done so to make them more palatable to most. They were very well seasoned though. I ordered the cr√®me br√ªl√©e banana pudding as dessert. It was also delicious. It's always great to go somewhere and get good food. But to have a great dining experience also is equally important to me. Pablo brought our drinks out with personality and a smile.

My girlfriend has made an 8pm reservation for us both for last Saturday. On arrival we were greeted with what looked like a cheeky smirk from the host who said that there was no table available to us in the dining area. They said that all they had was one of those little cafe tables available at the front window next to the cold entrance. She asked what we would like to do and I asked if we even had a choice to which she replied no. We were then forced to take one of those cramped tables at the front. At this stage I would have expected a manager to have apologized to us, maybe offer a drink on the house or even an appetizer, but nothing of the sort.  Myself and my girlfriend ordered our drinks and put in an appetizer order also. When those arrived we ordered our entree's. My girlfriend ordered the tomato basil pizza and it had an option to add soppressata which she asked to do. I asked for the steak and for it to be cooked medium well. 10-15 minutes later our food arrived out and it was a disappointment straight away. There was no soppressata on my girlfriends pizza and my steak was cooked rare. My girlfriend was very hungry so she ate the pizza regardless while I had to wait over 10 minutes for our server Nicole to arrive over to ask how everything was and I told her the truth, not great. She said she'd take my steak back to be cooked more and that my girlfriend wouldn't have to pay for the soppressata. Of course she wouldn't have to pay for something she didn't get. I thought she was going to say that she wouldn't have to pay for the pizza at that stage. My steak arrived out about 7/8 minutes later cooked medium well. At this point my girlfriend had finished eating her pizza while I was only getting the chance to start eating. At the time my steak was dropped back to me I asked for another drink. More disappointment to follow, it took for my whole steak dish to be eaten before my drink made its way to me! I was pissed off rightly by now. At this point Nicole, our server, took my empty plate away and also my water glass, why? I have no explanation for taking my glass. She didn't offer to refill it, she just took it. I was very angry at the whole experience and if it wasn't for my girlfriend preventing me causing a scene I would have asked to have seen a manager on duty. Neither my girlfriend nor I will ever step foot in this restaurant ever again.

We arrive at 6:15 & have 8:00 tickets for Kinky Boots at the UT Bass Hall (wonderful!) -  so we are a little boxed in on time, but the restaurant was rather deserted.  Food was great - more on that later, but our server was one of the WORST I've ever encountered.  I routinely tip 20%, but I gave her barely over 10%, and she deserved zero.  First, SIL orders a scotch & soda with a twist.  Server brings something we all guess is bourbon.  My husband likes bourbon, but she was going to charge us for it!  After he tasted it, he said \\"send it back\\".  Round 2:  SIL ask for Dewar's and soda with a twist - I think this is the bartender's fault - server shows up with a Scotch & LIME twist - Really?  who drinks Scotch & lime?  Insane!\\n\\nOn to the food:  they are no longer serving the bacon tater tots, which was annoying.  Take it off the menu if you are going to choose not to serve it.  Fried black eyed peas were a spicy, airy hit & a good amount (we had 4 people total).  Grilled ice berg salad was also tasty. Server disappears at this point before taking our dinner order.  In explicable since there is only one other table of people in the restaurant and maybe 2 tables of people drinking outside.  Finally, she returns to take our order after we finish the grilled lettuce.    My hubs had shrimp & grits - again tasty, well cooked & seasoned, tho' only 5 shrimp.  Clementine salad had NO clementines - it was meh.  Beef Bourguignon - ample portion, some of the beef was fatty, smoked mashed potatoes tasted like they were made with Liquid Smoke - OK.  We were splitting the beef, but we had to wait for the server to return with an extra dish, which evidently was stored in Round Rock - tick tock!\\n\\nMerlot meritage wine - Silver Buckle? - was fairly priced & quite delish.

Rainey Street mule was tasty.\\n\\nI could babble on about the server, but the bottom line is - I don't think she has ever held a wait job before, she was not well trained, and she pretty much ignored us.\\n\\nAlso, Yelp, you need to update the menu - it is woefully incorrect."},{"name":"Pollo Tropical","address":"7643 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"1.5","text":"Horrible service.

For a very genuine Hong Kong local style food place that serves real true Hong Kong food and does a great job at it, why do people go in there and order what they think is real Chinese food such as lo mein and fried rice and think that they really know Chinese food? And then say that it serves good Chinese food even though it may be a Vietnamese restaurant.  As another person pointed out, Saigon is a very famous section of Hong Kong, like Flushing is a part of New York City, even though it is also a particular part of my bathroom, but mixing them up is due to ignorance, and shows ignorance.  So please if you don't know what you are talking about, this is NOT a Vietnamese restaurant by any means.  Even though they do have Pho on the menu, I guarantee you that was not the reason for the restaurant's existence in the first place.  Maybe so many patrons went in at first and asked for it they decided to serve it even though it is not their forte, I don't know.  But please, you should be able to tell they are NOT a Vietnamese Restaurant, just like P F Chang is obviously not a Chinese restaurant either.  \\nOK let's get to the food. Their braised beef both in curry and not, are very tender and done the Hong Kong way and served either with noodles or rice are both very good. But the curry chicken I feel is infinitely even better.  I highly recommend that.  And yes if you have not tried the baked rice with pork chops you should try that too.  Not too many places offer that either in Boston area.\\nGreat hole in the wall with appropriately low prices and great food.

Also, on the night i was there ALL the beer taps went down. Literally NO DRAFT BEER available in the bar, with little available in bottle form beside overpriced Budweiser (to be fair, Bud is almost always overpriced). Later the owner came in to fix the problem, couldn't, and just gave up...seems like a bar emergency to me, but what do I know?

I got there at 8:50 on a Tuesday morning (they open at 11) and got my food at 12:20 or so. The wait itself didn't feel like 3 hours because of the nice people that are in line with you that are willing to make conversation with you. There's also wifi available there if you have Xfinity, plus Franklin's gives out cold water, chairs, and umbrellas, so it basically felt like working at a coffee shop while waiting in line for BBQ. I would maybe recommend getting there before 8 to get a seat in the shaded deck area though to make your experience a bit more pleasant. There's a coffee kiosk right by it too. \\n\\nMeats: got 1 lb of ribs, 1 lb of brisket, 1 sausage, and 1 slice of smoked turkey to share between me and my friend. I think the amount would have been perfect if we had cut down the brisket by half a pound. We both agreed the star of the show were the ribs. We also enjoyed the sausage and smoked turkey because they exceeded our expectations. Unfortunately while the brisket was still tasty, it felt short of our expectations because of how hyped up it was, so we ranked it last among the meats. My friend also got the lemon chess pie, which tasted like a lemon bar but a less firm filling and a more flakey homemade crust.\\n\\nTip: if you are looking to just buy some brisket to bring home, you can place an order online the first Monday of each month, but I think you have to make it one month in advance. For this order, they will only give you chilled brisket that's prepackaged already, so it actually travels well. Also, you can skip the line, so that's another bonus. I think there might be a $75 order minimum, but it's not very hard to meet when brisket is $22/lb."},{"name":"The Greenery Creamery","address":"420 E Church St, Unit 112","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Was craving some ice cream on a hot Florida day so I decided to check this place out and see if it lived up to the hype.

Hubs had the special, Poolside, with rum and juices for $10. I had my summer fave, a French 75. Great bartender!\\nNext, we were sat upstairs where its a little more quiet. We started with the oysters with andoullie sausage! Yum! Perfectly sized with 5 baked oysters. Just enough to start. For our salad course we both had the peach and blueberry salad. The peaches were ripe and sweet. I think this was my favorite of the whole night!\\nFor entrees the hubs had the fried chicken ($25) they are famous for and I had the lamb ($34) with a side of collards. The fried chicken did not disappoint! So perfect! I kept sneaking bites off his plate. My lamb was delicious and cooked just right going with the chef's recommendation of medium rare. It came with a side of squash and zucchini, but I had to have those collards! They are so good!\\nSince it was our anniversary, we splurged and got 2 desserts.

I made a reservation a week in advance and for 2 on a Friday night, I had 5:15 or 8:45 to choose from. Hot spot! We arrived 10 minutes early and they said they were running pretty tight to reservation times, so we headed to the bar. We scored one seat, so I sat and my boyfriend stood behind me. The decor and atmosphere of this place was awesome! It was dimly lit, with a great bar scene, as well as dining area. And it was so much bigger inside than I expected! We ordered two glasses of wine, white for me, red for him. At least 10 minutes later, still no wine. The bartender was definitely busy, but we thought he maybe forgot us. They could have used probably one more bartender for a busy Friday night. By then, the hostess grabbed us and led us to our table.. sans wine. Within 5 minutes of checking out the menu, the bartender came over to our table with an unopened bottle of red and one white. He apologized profusely for forgetting us and we thought this was a really nice gesture. He explained the wines and why he thought we would like them based on our preferences. My white was so crisp and fresh! It was really nice that he tracked us down. And they comped our first round of drinks for the inconvenience! Great customer service.\\n\\nOur waitress was great, super bubbly, excited about the restaurant, and excited that we were first-timers. She had short, super curly hair, forget her name but she was great!!\\n\\nOk, onto the food. Food ordered: crispy chicken nuggs, kale salad, honey glazed burrata, chicken fried rabbit, pork shoulder, and then for dessert baked apple and olive oil cake trifle. To start, they brought over pickled green beans, which were surprisingly really good. \\n\\nCrispy chicken nuggs: ughh, bad decision. I think I only ate them because I was starving. It was shredded dark meat chicken, fried into a crispy ball, with a spicy creamy dipping sauce. There were 3 on the plate and we only ate two, neither of us wanted the last one. Wouldn't order this again. \\n\\nKale salad: WOW, yes it is as good as everyone says. My boyfriend haaates kale, and he loved this! The creamy pistachio with little bits of crunchy pistachio, yummm. I could eat this every day. Good size portion too!\\n\\nHoney glazed burrata: Man, I love burrata, but this didn't hit the spot for me. The combo of honey and burrata was great, but it needed salt soo badly! The pumpkin caponata did nothing for me. There was also not enough of the crisps to eat it with.\\n\\nChicken fried rabbit: Yum! Wish there was a little more rabbit flavor, but overall really tasty. Worked well with the celery, blue cheese, apple on the plate. I almost wish the garnishes were chopped into a little \\"salsa\\" if you will, to get a little of each bite with the rabbit.\\n\\nPork shoulder: Ehh, this was ok. Flavors worked well together, but I guess when I read \\"slow roasted\\" I assumed that it was going to be fall apart pieces of pork, which it wasn't. Nice meat dish though, would order again.\\n\\nApple olive oil cake trifle: Meh. I was hoping for more of a \\"wow this dessert was the perfect ending\\".. buuut it wasn't. It was ok. Cake was great texture and sponginess, wish the apples were a little softer.\\n\\nOverall, delicious meal and loved that we got to try quite a bit.

Fish scale lamps and cows hanging off of the ceiling- I wouldn't expect anything less cheesy at Universal Studios. There's a sushi bar where you can sit to pretend you're having an authentic Japanese experience, and a patio balcony that overlooks the lively CityWalk. \\n\\nThe menu features burgers, sushi, and burgushi. Burgushi comes in two forms- burgers with sushi ingredients, or sushi with burger toppings. If this doesn't sound appetizing to you at all, you're not alone.

We also ordered The Cowfish has Officially Left the Building burger as backup. \\n\\nThe burger was fantastic. Peanut butter and fried bananas are a classic pair, combined with bacon that culminated in my foodgasm. We asked for lettuce and tomatoes because a burger just feels so bare without it.

Getting to the bathroom was a journey in itself. The types of people at the bar fell into two groups. Group #1 - blonde, not from Boston, outfitted head to toe in preppy attire, and talking about weekends on their yacht. Group #2 - older men in business attire who probably just came from their offices in the financial district nearby. If that's your scene, then come on through! When we were finally able to get to the bar, the bartender moved on to the next customer because we apparently took too long to order. You can forget about finding somewhere to sit down.

We all drove separately not knowing there would be a line out the door to order at a counter instead of table service. Since we all arrived at different times, some of the group was inside and ordered, some of the group was toward the front of the line and the remainder of the group toward the end of the line. So we ate in 3 different sittings. The first group was done eating before the last group even got their food. Because of this, we took up half a large table for almost 2 hours.\\nThe food was good, a few of us even had some baked goods, which were also good. But not good enough to me to justify waiting in line outside for so long, and having to eat separate from the rest of your party, if you don't all arrive at the same time.\\nIt was also FREEZING inside, my food went from hot to ice cold in a matter of minutes.\\nThe one thing I have to note, that makes up for some of the trouble, was the friendliness of the staff.

It took a bit but I finally came here the other day. It was really good! Coffee was awesome, I don't drink anything too special, I usually get an Americano but it definitely was nice and smooth going down.  I ordered a Miracle Max sammich. I wanted sausage but the dude behind the counter said they didn't have sausage but they had vegetarian sausage. Immediately I was like mehhhhhh. He said it's the best kind, Field Roast. OK, I took the bait but I was super skeptical. I asked for tomato ketchup, he said they didn't have any they have home made hot sauce and the sammich had tomato jam. OK... ok. I'm down.\\n\\nBoom! Sammich was the bomb, I'm definitely going back on Sunday. Maybe this will be our regular Sunday spot. The sausage was nowhere near the best, I'm not sure what would be other than a pork sausage but I told him on the way out, I'd give it a 9/10. It was good but it was no meat sausage. I wish people would stop marketing vegetarian food as meat. Someone has to figure that out.

I have however had Indian food in many different countries, made from Indian friends, and many different styles of Indian food. \\n\\nI had high hopes for Saffron. With all the positive reviews I was hoping this would be my go to Indian place to fill the void since Star Of India changed chefs 2 years ago and it went downhill. Sadly it did not \\"wow\\" me. I went at lunch and it wasn't too busy which was nice but also lent itself to hearing every conversation going on in that room. Staff was wonderful and offered suggestions on their favorite dishes and popular dishes. I decided on the lamb stuffed jalape√±os, samosas, goat curry, jalape√±o naan and per their suggestion, their chicken dumplings. Let me start by saying that the stuffed jalape√±o and samosas were PERFECTLY fried. They have their oil temp right and the batter/dough they use, perfection. The Samosas were very flavorful but the jalape√±o not as much. Next was the goat curry with rice. The goat was tender and flavorful but was not trimmed as best as it could've been. Lots of fatty seams and such that after avoiding the bones and cutting away the fat & gristle, there wasn't much there to make a meal. The rice.... clumpy and dry in some areas. Almost like it was old rice that they tried to reheat. Shameful. The jalape√±o naan texture was good. I was surprised that it had cheese in it. I asked why and they said to keep the naan together since the jalape√±os inside would cause some separation. But, the cheese wasn't melted at all so it kind of defeated the purpose of its addition to what could've been a delicious naan. Finally the dumplings. What can I say? Not my favorite. They seemed really out of place and it wasn't flavorful enough to make an impact. The sauce didn't compliment it either. The price is definitely not worth it. \\nI took a look at the buffet and the selection was less than spectacular. Only a few meat selections and the rest is yogurts or vegetarian side dishes like options. So be aware that you are getting what you are paying for. \\n\\nAll in all I would say that this place is a nice change. Unassuming location, but a beautiful space for what they have! It is BYOB but there is a liquor/wine store next door and they provide proper glassware for your drink. Prices are a little high and a lot of my dishes were lacking the basic element of salt. Everything was under seasoned. But I would come back at least one more time. 2 of my 5 dishes were nice. Service was friendly and prompt.

The hostess, waitstaff, and kitchen staff are astounding and keep the tables turning quickly. There are just so many people waiting which is why there is a still a delay in getting into the restaurant.  I do wish that they took reservations since we have to drive down from Olympia on top of waiting  (yes, the food is that good).  A cover for the waiting area would be nice also since it's prone to raining in Portland. \\nThe food is outstanding. We've eaten both breakfast and dinner here. I haven't had a meal that I didn't enjoy.  The brisquit wasn't my favorite but it was still good. Breakfast is my favorite since they serve grits. I grew up in the south, for 28 years, and can honestly say that these are the best grits I've ever had (don't tell my mom I said that...).  I love to eat steak and have eaten at some of the most well known steakhouses across the nation and find that the steak specials here are as good as and generally better than the steakhouses. \\nThe servers are extremely friendly and willing to answer questions about more than the restaurant. We have gotten good suggestions on things to do from them.  The hostess that works the dinner shift is among at her job. She keeps everything flowing and is excellent at providing accurate wait times. The kitchen is willing to make substitutions and alterations to specials when needed. We travel down at least once a month to enjoy the food here and it's well worth the 90 minute drive and wait once there. We also always try to take out of state visitors here.

Sure.  Worth the wait?  No.  \\n\\nI love BBQ.  Like, I LOVE BBQ.  My dream job is to be a BBQ judge.  You get the idea.  Coming to Franklin was a little like jumping on any trendy bandwagon like Twilight or Harry Potter.  People are there taking pictures.  Everyone is talking about how amazing it is.  There are articles stating how it is the best BBQ ever.  Reviews stating that eating at Franklin is a religious experience, a must.  I was skeptical as is my way, but I was definitely expecting something really good.  Maybe not the best EVER, but really really good.\\n\\nNow, they were already sold out of turkey and pulled pork by the time they got to us, but we did get brisket, sausage, and ribs.  The first thing I tried was the brisket.  Moist, falling apart, kind of like meaty butter.  But....where is the smokey flavor?  Where is the delicious blackened BBQ spice flavor?  Maybe I didn't get enough of the blackened edge.  I take another bite.  No, definitely good beef, but no BBQ flavor.  Reminds me of really good pot roast.  If you like pot roast flavored brisket, you'll love it.  For me, I want my brisket to have that amazing smokey, blackened spice flavor.  It just wasn't there, sadly.\\n\\nNext, I tried the sausage.  I liked it.  It is spiced well and the casing is perfectly crisp, but not tough.  Again, not smokey, but I enjoyed it.\\n\\nFinally, my ribs.  Ribs are my favorite and I was again met with a lacking flavor.  Also, only half of the ribs were falling apart tender.  The rest were tough, dry, and stringy.  Sigh.\\n\\nSauces...the espresso sauce just isn't my thing.  The other two were too runny for my taste.  I like a thick, peppery red sauce if I use any sauce at all.\\n\\nThe sides were meh.  I've had WAY better potato salad (I can MAKE better potato salad easy).  Beans were alright.  Don't like slaw so who knows.\\n\\nWhat I did like was the pecan pie.  Super amazing delicious pie.  Made by Cake and Spoon....but still sooo good.  \\n\\nSo, there you go.  Take it or leave it.  Also, keep in mind that as it is cedar season I am having cedar fever.

I'm a bit disappointed. I've heard non stop raves about this place, from all my buds here in ATX. My friends know I love me some ramen, and know that everywhere I go in Manhattan and Brooklyn back in NYC, I'm always up for some ramen.\\n\\nSo finally in my second home, in good ol' ATX, I have the pleasure to try some of the best, and that is RAMEN TATSU-YA  --- at first it was slightly hard to find, due to it being very dark. It's wedged between a post office and another business... So I passed it twice.\\n\\nYou walk in and have to order first, and then grab a table. Unfortunately the TONKATSU creamy pork broth ramen is not available for lunch, only the old school ramen and veggie. Very very disappointed... I need that TONKATSU in my life, once I try it I will update my review.\\n\\nI had no choice but to order the Old School ramen that comes with a hardboiled egg that tastes as though it's  been marinated in a teriyaki sauce (ajitama). I got the extra meat, if not it only has one slice of BBQ pork belly  :(   that quickly turned my bowl from $9.50 to $13.50 --- the bowl is made with a chicken broth, which I'm not to fond of. It also comes with the fixins like scallions , a nori sheet and bamboo shoots.\\n\\nI also got a beer... A dumb idea...  Not sure why, but a Sapporo seemed like a good idea (NOT!) So my lunch Came out to $21.45... Dumb, but even without the beer I'm looking at $14+ for a bowl of ramen with extra meat.... That's getting real close to the world renown MOMOFUKU bowl in NYC that  starts at $16.50 ---- yeah... That's pricey especially for lunch.\\n\\nSo my main concern is how fast it came out. This tells me everything is premade and not made to order. The broth and noodles I understand should be made before hand and with love, but the pork belly, especially, should be made right on the spot so it really brings out the zest and KAPOW! factor in the soup. Oh yeah, and the noodles... Yeah the noodles, a very important factor - it seemed skimpy, just not enough... And they seemed slightly over cooked - I love my ramen noodle to be chewy, and thicker.\\n\\nOverall it was good, but until I try that TONKATSU, my experience has been decent... I'm more of a soy miso broth or pork broth ramen type of guy... You can't get that true ramen experience without it.... There's magic in that pork broth I tells ya!

The baked beans are smoky and saucy. Potato salad and cole slaw represent strong elements of the backyard barbecue and the collard greens (with bits of bacon) blend vinegar and sweetness evenly. The corn bread is extremely moist and very pleasant.\\n\\nMake sure to come on Monday night (5 to 11 PM) for all you can eat wings!"},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Dim sum not bad but not otherworldly.

I'm SO glad we did it! What made the wait bearable was that they served beer to those waiting in line, not for free of course. If you planned ahead, an ice chest with your own stock of beer would have been with you. Also one of their sweetest employees came around to kind of take your order and guesstimate how much meat and what type they would have. By the time the guy got to us he said that the pork ribs would be sold out. We were pretty bummed out about that but we still stayed in line. We met an awesome couple from Philadelphia in line right behind us. That definitely made us enjoy the wait even more. The best part was when they served us a piece of their sausage with white bread.

Unfortunately what I got was a sandwich with all the cheese sauce tucked in the bottom of the pita, and plain cucumber slices towards the top...along with a few pieces of pickled celery - totally unbalanced. so much for tasting everything in each bite.

Last saturday, my boyfriend, his family and I decided to go to Tasty Burger after the Red Sox game. We sat down and after a while our waiter eventually came over to take our drink orders.  When it was time to take our food orders, he stopped my boyfriend's brother in the middle of his order to watch what was on the television... When my boyfriend's brother's girlfriend hesitated during her order, he immediately said \\"I'll come back\\" and ran off. Rude, but we let it go.  My boyfriend and I are currently waiters, and everyone else at the table had been waiters at some point in their life, so we are very understanding and patient when eating at restaurants.  After our food was brought to us (by a different server), he never came over to check how everything was or get us more drinks.  We asked him for the check and waited another 10-15 minutes before one of my boyfriend's brothers waved him over to ask for the check again. The waiter stopped and glared at us.  He then said, \\"Never do this (talking about the waving) to me again. It's rude.\\" We were shocked. None of us were trying to be rude, we just wanted our check! And even if it was rude.. DEAL WITH IT. That's his job as a waiter to deal with the public.  He continued to argue with us and yell, saying that we were being rude. After exchanging more words about his disrespect, we asked for the manager.  Instead of getting the manager, our waiter printed out the check and threw it on our table. After realizing the manager wasn't coming over, one of my boyfriend's brothers went and got him himself.  We calmly explained the situation and it was immediately evident that this manager has no control over his staff.  All he said was, \\"I'm sorry, I'll definitely talk to him.\\" He was polite, but I just don't think that was the appropriate way to handle a waiter who yells and argues with his customers.  As we were talking to the manager, the waiter was standing to the side glaring at us.  Once the manager walked away, rather than apologizing, the waiter comes over and starts yelling at us again!  He then said to us, \\"NEVER SHOW YOUR FACE IN HEAR AGAIN, OR THAT'S A WRAP.\\" Yes, the waiter THREATENED us.  He continued yelling at us and began putting his hands on one of my boyfriend's brothers' chest in a very aggressive manner, getting angrier and angrier.  Then, he pulled our chairs out behind us and said \\"GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY RESTAURANT!\\" I repeat. The WAITER told us to get out of \\"HIS\\" restaurant.  All the while, the manager was not doing a thing.  We left and asked to speak to the manager outside.  We were so frustrated at this point.  He apologized, but flat out said there was nothing he could do.  He said it was a saturday night, they were busy and he needed the waiter to stay.  This manager has absolutely no control over his staff and that is why his waiters act like complete animals.  I'm not positive of the manager's name, I think it might have been Dave, he was an African American male with longer hair. I don't remember the waiter's name either because it was something exotic, \\"Issa\\" maybe? Either way, I am absolutely disgusted with this type of service and will never ever eat there again.  This is not the first time I have had poor service there.  The staff is always unfriendly and inattentive and just plain rude. For example, one time my friend and I were given small sodas but were charged for larges.  When we POLITELY asked the waiter to change it she got frustrated saying \\"If you don't want to pay for your sodas fine!\\" But, still didn't end up adjusting the bill.  My point is, this restaurant is OUT OF CONTROL. The only reason why they are in business is because they are located right by Fenway and in a college/touristy area.  The food is good, but you might as well go down the street to burger king where you would definitely get better service. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't tolerate/reward this kind of behavior by taking your business there!!! There are plenty of other good restaurants in the area that don't treat their customers this way.  What if a fight had broken out? Customers or even worse, children, could've gotten seriously injured all because of the angry staff that works there! This is by far the worst restaurant experience any of us had ever had. I really hope you keep this review in mind the next time you think about eating there.  We had done nothing to provoke such angry and rude behavior from the waiter, so I can only imagine what he does when dealing with actually difficult customers. This restaurant does not deserve to be in business so please do not help keep it that way!"},{"name":"Sunshine Diner","address":"2649 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Really good for breakfast.

I first loaded up my plate with some yellow rice and beans, some this cornbread and bacon and veggie stuffing type thing, and  a ground beef and veggie empanada filling mixture, and sweet plaintains and then headed over to the grill. I grabbed some sausage, chicken and a bit of steak. The salad bar items were pretty good, but the rice was extremely oily and kind of got on everything else on the plate. The plaintains and the chicken were outstanding, crispy and moist in all the right places. I could've done without the sausage, and the steak was overcooked.\\n\\nMy second trip back got more plaintains (so good!) and some spiced grilled pineapple, which was definitely the star of the night.

I went to No Mas for the first time last night for dinner with a group of friends and we enjoyed it!  The atmosphere is very cool and \\"Mexican-y\\" but not tacky.  It is a large space with plenty of room and a second level (they have an elevator too which came in handy for my friend on crutches when we found out we'd be sitting upstairs!)  Our wait time was minimal for a Saturday night, and our waiter (I forgot his name but he had blonde curly hair and freckles) was very fast and attentive and took good care of us.  Before being seated we hung out at the bar for a few minutes.  I noticed their massive version of a \\"pitcher\\" of margaritas--it comes in a huge colorful vase!  \\n\\nI am always a little irked, though, when the only option for parking is valet, and the salsa didn't wow me either--it was brownish in color (what is up with brown salsa these days?)  I like my salsa to be the color of fresh tomatoes and have tons of fresh ingredients with plenty of cilantro.  Not at No Mas.  I guess some people prefer a more \\"smoky\\" salsa and if so, No Mas is the place to get it.\\n\\nThe rest of the meal was great--I ordered the Fish Tacos which had plenty of lightly-fried fish and purple cabbage with a yummy creamy chipotle sauce, accompanied by rice and beans.  It was a ton of food for just $11.  My friends all enjoyed their entrees as well.  My frozen margarita was spot-on, no complaints there!\\n\\nThe prices were definitely reasonable considering the up-and-coming location in the Castleberry Hill neighborhood.\\n\\nI am glad that No Mas moved further south, closer to me!

I like being able to carry on at the top of my lungs and not be the loudest person in the room; I being able to make a tremendous mess of my already messy meal and not have to feel a lick of embarrassment; I like the unintentional comedy of the typical crowd this place attracts; and yes, I even like the food (well, some of it...well, a few things). \\n\\nI don't like the Eau de Border, though, the nearly tangible odor which wafts about the place and even down Church St., which is so tenacious that I've often had to burn clothes and take baths in tomato juice afterward just to get the smell out....

However, I felt the staff from SE wine collective was really pushy on  their own personal wines. I get that you're really proud of your personal wine, but don't make me feel uncomfortable or offended when I order or buy a bottle of wine outside of your personal making.  His wine was average with a high amount of tannins.  Not my favorite.  I did, however, really enjoy the guest wine maker's wine.\\n\\nRight next to the bar is their winery which looks like a warehouse.  They had a private party in there with bright Florissant lights pouring into this tiny bar that was dimly lit.  It really killed the ambiance.  At some point someone was smart enough to turn off these lights an hour after the party vacated, but that lasted about five minutes when someone turned them back on and they stayed on the rest of the night.  \\n\\nAlso the bathroom situation is something more to be desired.  If you have to use it, you have to walk through the private room/warehouse, go to a random door, and then exit through a different door, go outside and then walk around the building to get back into the wine bar.  \\n\\nMy recommendation to the owners, maybe hire some bartenders who aren't set on trying to push only handcrafted wine or learn to offer different wines because everyone has different tastes.  I believe there's several wine makers here, but the one that served are table was only set on ONLY recommending his own.  Sorry but that's just tacky.  And again tacky to the guest wine maker your bar invited.  \\n\\nMaybe I'll try this one more time, if I'm in the area and someone else wants to go, but the first time was not great compared to the other wine bars I've been to scattered throughout Portland and I can't say that I'm going to recommend it to others to come back."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've been here 3 times, and each time the food was really good.

One of the owners greeted us and served us -- and I learned that it is a local institution of sorts, family owned and run, and perhaps nearing the end of its long and storied life.  I had a kabob; my daughter a soup of some kind.  Both were excellent.  The place is more festive on Saturday night when there is belly dancing -- a distraction I would not have enjoyed for this occasion.   The decor is kind of dark and, frankly, a bit depressing without the noise and gaiety of people dancing.

Fox Brox BarBQ does well, but I'll be honest that I've had better in my humble opinion.\\n\\nSo here's the lowdown. My boyfriend and I went there for dinner on a Friday night after work and the weather was so nice we wanted to sit outside. Fox Bros has a giant outdoor patio that's probably three seasons because it has a large pergola overhead supporting heating units for cool weather and fans for warm (I don't know if they have some kind of a cover they pull out for inclement weather but I would assume so).\\n\\nAlthough the patio is large, the parking lot is hideously small (just like most parking in most places around Little Five Points). People were double parked or up on the grass all over the place. \\n\\nThat gripe aside though, we got there around 7 and although it was busy, we only waited a few minutes before getting a nice seat outside. Our waitress was out to our table in a jiffy and took good care of us throughout our meal. \\n\\nMy boyfriend hadn't had a chance for lunch that day so he was close to gnawing his own arm off when I suggested we share the Everything Plate: the biggest combo plate on the meun. They have 5 meat selections and you choose 4 plus 2 sides. We opted for the sliced beef brisket, ribs, chicken and pulled pork with 2 servings of Brunswick stew so we could both have our own cups.\\n\\nIn no time at all the plate heaped with meat was delivered to the table and we dug in. The pork was tender, the chicken was juicy, the rub on the ribs was tasty and the brisket wasn't too fatty. Fox Bros' barbecue sauce is more liquid than some and more tangy than sweet, but it went well with everything. And the Brunswick stew was ok; not the best incarnation I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. \\n\\nI really enjoyed the patio and ambiance of Fox Bros, the food was good (but I still think Community Q BBQ is better), and the parking was a cluster.

The quesadilla was the best decision out of the three. The pulled chicken and guac made the quesadilla amazing. However, the BBQ pork egg rolls were overly salty and had a very polarizing taste. The mustard sauce underneath it did not go well with it either. Would not recommend the BBQ egg rolls. Lastly the bean soup was .....well ...a bean soup.

Admittedly, I don't get to that neighborhood much but whenever we talk about going to eat there, Masa comes up. We went recently to celebrate the holidays with six of our closest friends. Despite our larger party (8), Masa was able to accommodate us even though it looked like they had another very large group and a birthday party going on at the same time. This made it a little loud but what can you do.\\nOur server was very attentive and several of us started out with drinks. Being a Southwest inspired restaurant, there is a lot of tequila based concoctions on the menu and I tried the \\"Apple Cinnamon Margarita\\" which from the cinnamon coated rim to the tart green apple slice in the glass was fantastic. My wife had the the white sangria and reported favorably, especially about the extra punch the fruit gave to the drink. I have had a tequila flight here in the past and it is a great way to get introduced to the types of tequilas that are available. \\nAppetizers followed and the scallops and BBQ duck was delicious and ample enough for two to share. Others in our party had butternut squash soup which they loved and taquitos. One of my FAVORITE things about Masa is the bread service. They have the most luscious, decadent, creamy maple butter that when paired with their warm cornbread, can just about explode any tastebud. Too bad they don't just do an unlimited bread deal like Olive Garden, because I would be there in a heartbeat. \\nEntrees that were ordered include a dayboat cod with sweet potato crust, pork medallions in a pumpkin sauce and lamb shank. Honestly I was too busy enjoying the succulent pork I had to notice much of what was going on around me. The meal was spicy but not overpowering and the aforementioned corn bread was handy to have as a sauce sucker. Everyone else liked their food and I think the meal turned out great. Like I said, it was a little loud in the bar area (where we were seated) so conversation was a little clipped but for the type of occasion that we were celebrating, it was perfect. \\nOne of these days, I'd love to get down for a lunch or brunch and see what offerings there are.

I had:\\n\\n- Slow Cooked Flageolet Beans\\n- Black Mission Fig & Ebony Heart Pluot Salad\\n- Roasted Beet Salad\\n\\nThese were all very tasty, if you couldn't tell by just their titles!  Be warned though - the portions are huge.  Another girl in the party had shrimp and grits and loved it too.  We were all so full that we couldn't fit in dessert, but it looked amazing too.\\n\\nAll in all - great southern cuisine, lots of local flavor and good veggie options."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I finally had a chance to tryout this place and they did not disappoint; had some areas of opportunity which I'll address. I had the brisket and ribs. Let me start with the brisket; its true; its the best around. The brisket was moist, tasty(a tad bit salty), the flavor was on point, the bark was the best part. The ribs; its true; they're the best around. They were full of flavor and you can see and taste they put in a lot of work in time into the preparation. The sauce was basically liquid smoke but i did not need any. I didn't get a chance to try the sausage I heard it wasn't that great according to my brother but i'll have to see for myself.

I was worried after reading another review that mentioned the unauthentic food but most people seemed happy so I stuck with the plan to go.   \\n\\nTo start, the decor is a hodge podge of island themed photos.  Not really Caribbean though - there are hula girls and Cuban art and photos of the keys.  Not sure if they just thought that anything beachy would go together but it seemed unpolished.   The music was also off - it sounded like 60s surfing music -  I was hoping for more Celia Cruz and Buena Vista Social Club.   It felt very touristy to me.  \\n\\nThe menu was fairly limited - I had the ribs for the appetizers and ropa vieja for the main course.  Both meats were chewy.  The ribs were especially tough and very messy to eat.   I've had my share of ropa vieja in Miami and this was not even close.  The spices seemed more tex-mex than Cuban/Puerto Rican and those cultures don't use coconut rice.   Where did the chefs get their recipes?   I agree with another poster that they should use more Caribbean spices like cumin and garlic and add more black beans and rice with plantains.   Please look up Cuban or Puerto Rican restaurants with high reviews in Miami and their menus should be used as a guide.  \\n\\nThe drinks were decent at least.

My brunch experience at South Kity Kitchen was truly memorable and will go down in history as one of the finest brunches ever.\\n\\nIn my eyes--and in many nutritionist's eyes--breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Not only that, but it's usually the tastiest. We came to South City Kitchen on our last day in Atlanta for their Sunday brunch. Our server's name was Kandiss and she immediately made us feel at home and like we were very valued customers. I love when servers actually have a knowledge of the food on the menu and can let you know what to order and what to steer away from (if any.) The recommendations that she made ended up being my favorite things we ordered, specifically the fried green tomatoes and the beef eggs Benedict. \\n\\nI ordered the Shrimp and grits, my husband went with the beef eggs benedict w/grits and then my brother went with the BBQ pork sandwich and the she crab soup. We also ordered pimento cheese and the fried green tomatoes as appetizers. I liked my shrimp and grits, but it wasn't my favorite rendition of it. The beef eggs bennedict was the true winner. The shredded beef, along with the lightness of the eggs and the lemony hollandaise sauce all worked together to make a perfect breakfast treat. The BBQ pork looked good, but I didn't try any of it. The she crab soup was reeeally amazing and I was pleasantly surprised by the generous amount of crab in the soup.\\n\\nI would say the only letdown was the pimento cheese appetizer. I would have preferred some softer bread but it only came with these crunchy crackers that weren't very braces friendly. Obviously the other two people at my table didn't have the same problem and crunched away, but I tend to stay away from anything that seems too hard. I ended up just putting the pimento on the cornbread that we were given and that ended up tasting really good. The fried green tomatoes were succulent and I really enjoyed the fact that it had goat cheese in the middle. It was a different take on a southern staple that we'd had a few times already.\\n\\nI don't think you can go wrong with anything on the brunch menu at South City Kitchen, but I can't stress enough to get the Beef Eggs Benedict if you're into that sorta thing.\\n\\nThank you to Kandiss and the rest of the staff at SCK for sending us home on a high note!"},{"name":"Stelios Restaurant","address":"293 Boston Rd","city":"Billerica","stars":"2.5","text":"This place is the best for homestyle eating.

So this past weekend, one of my girlfriends was turning 28 and decided to celebrate her birthday with dinner and karaoke with some of her good friends.  And she chose to have dinner at Cafe 101.  Good deal.\\n\\nWe arrived around 7:30 on Saturday night and it was a good thing she'd made a reservation for our group of 16 because there was already another party at one large table, multiple couples filling up the two tops around the raised outer edge of the restaurant and another reservation taking up more square tables in the main dining area as well.  We sat right down though, greeted friends and admired the decor of the place.  It's very unique inside as well as out: the entire back wall of the place looked as though it'd been painstakingly collaged with unique pictures, advertisements, photos and newspapers.  I don't know if Cafe 101 did this or one of its previous incarnations (this spot has gone through many iterations and owners), but it was pretty darn cool looking.  \\n\\nOnce most of the group had arrived and assembled itself around the two large tables reserved for us and the waitresses has taken our drink orders, we set about ordering.  And naturally ordered so much food, no one went away feeling less than stuffed with leftovers still.  The group at my table ordered multiple spicy basil chicken dishes (which all came out in sizzling hot iron woks), ma po tofu, tangerine beef, spicy beef, cashew chicken, tomato tofu soup, spring rolls, and they also brought us complimentary radish and cabbage appetizers and fried red bean balls with sesame seeds for dessert (for my friend's birthday).\\n\\nWhile I didn't find anything particularly spicy (I'm guessing they dumbed it down for the more American palate), I enjoyed the basil chicken, and once I got over the initial surprise that the tangerine and spicy beef were both deep fried and a little heavily sauced, I thought those were pretty good too.  Actually, the cashew chicken was very tasty and the ma po tofu wasn't bad either - and like I said, there were plenty of leftovers when we finally departed.  You could easily split a dish between two people and be totally satisfied upon departure.\\n\\nGiven the size of our party, the waitresses did a very job taking care of all of us in a timely manner, keeping our water glasses filled, bringing out more white rice and splitting up the bills at the end.

Definitely a cool interesting concept to serve sushi/burgers, hence the \\"Cowfish\\" name. Location was extremely busy on a Friday night, but with a prior reservation, you'll be seated promptly. \\n\\nFor starters, we had the \\"Parmesan Bacon Truffle Fries\\" and \\"Big Al's Yellowtail\\" appetizers. The truffle fries were served hot, evenly seasoned with a great cheesy taste. Not too oily or drenched, just the right texture, definitely addicting!! The Yellowtail appetizers was ok, just your average \\"hamachi jalapeno\\". Presentation was nice though.\\n\\nMain courses were \\"The All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi\\", \\"The Fusion Specialty Bento Box\\", and the \\"Chef's Deluxe 15pc Sashimi Mix\\". \\n\\nThe roll, garnished heavy with a pico de gallo like mixture, was wrapped with soy paper and potato string fries, deep fried. Inside, there is a solid piece of black angus beef with a house specialty sauce. Definitely a unique mixture of ingredients, however, a pleasant taste. Perfect for a burger head, not so much for a sushi lover. \\n\\nThe Fusion Bento Box contained half roll with Tuna, Edamame, Cucumber Salad, and a small slider. Nothing too crazy, decent taste for all. \\n\\nThe Sashimi Dinner contained a mixture of Tuna, Salmon, Octopus, Surf Clam, Lobster, Sweet Shrimp, and some white fish. Unfortunately, being an avid sushi/sashimi lover, the dish wasn't much to rave about. Most of the fish had a slightly frozen texture to them, which is expected though, for a busy place whos main focus is a fusion style. Would not order again, specifically for the pricing of the dish.\\n\\nOverall, the place is definitely a fun, hip atmosphere, in the heart of CityWalk in Universal. Pricing is definitely on the higher side, but expected due to location. Definitely recommend the burgers and fries aspect of the restaurant!!

I love ramen.  I love noodles.  I perpetuate a stereotype, whatever I don't care.  \\n\\nI have been to this place like 4 times now.  It's location is weird for the type of restaurant it is.  Meaning-this place is really cute and modern, and clean and from the looks of it and quality of food seems like it belongs more somewhere in the trendy, clean part of the east side or dt.  Instead its off of Peton Gin & 183 in a strip mall.  You can throw a rock and hit that Target from there.  The surrounding restaurants are old, and there's even an old, and now closed I think, funky Asian market a few doors down.  \\n\\nThe decor and ambiance is upbeat, hip, \\"cool\\" and a little \\"hipster-y.\\"  The art in the bathroom is pretty awesome.  The food is amaze!  Here's what I've sampled so far:\\n\\nAll of the ramen bowls.  The pork belly is divinely rich, indulgent and melt-in-your-mouth.  The miso-hot is my least fav, even though it's ridiculously good-I prefer the pork belly to the ground pork.  The #2 is my fav.  *On our last visit they introduced this new ramen, which is a dipping ramen-the noodles are bigger and instead of sitting in a broth you dip them in a separate bowl of thicker broth.  I have not tried this new dipping ramen but it did look good and because of the community seating I got two opinions on it.  I'll probably give it a go at some point.  There are lots of different kinds of add-ons to dress up your ramen even more.  You can get really wild and crazy if you want.  I.E.-the bombs*\\n\\nI have had the yodas every single time I've gone.  Once I got two orders of them and my husband and I ate an order each instead of sharing them bc they are that good.  The dumplings are ok.  Michi Ramen's are better.  The spicy edamame is good, but it's got minced onions on it and I don't like onions.  On my next visit I'm going to try the slider.  It comes with Japanese potato salad and I'm very intrigued.  Omg, yodas.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ramen is stellar.  It's very very rich and filling.  I can't get through an entire bowl.  It's too much.  You do have the option of getting more noodles if you finish the ones you've got and need more.  This place is getting a lot of press and attention right now and rightly so because it's just flipping good.  Sometimes the line is crazy and we opt not to go bc of the wait.  But, if you plan it just right it usually takes about 15 minutes from the door to the table.  This place is tiny and they do community seating.  They also have separate tables, but the community seating thing is kindof fun because you can look at all the stuff everyone else is ordering and decide if it looks good to you.  And, if there's something you haven't tried you can ask them how they like it.  This is a really great place for a date or outing with friends.  They do have alcohol, and sake. GET THE YODAS.  You'll be glad you did.  Thanks to writing this review all my brain can think about is yodas, yodas, yodas.  I could just go and eat those and be happy.  I love them so so much that I have thought about trying to recreate them at home but I don't think I'm savvy enough to do it.  \\n\\nI keep seeing on their sign that a vegetarian option is coming soon.  I really wish it would hurry and come sooner!  I am very eager to try a vegetarian option for the ramen."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Everything about this place is cute and a nice neighborhood space.

Will return again."},{"name":"Milestone 229","address":"229 Civic Center Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I will start by saying I had lunch here a couple weeks ago and enjoyed the food (though pricey) and had great service.  However, I decided to take my mom here on Mother's day and I can honestly say it was some of the worst service i have had at a restaurant.  I was furious (but kept it to myself) because it was mother's day and they were not crowded or understaffed...there were workers just standing around.  Because it rained, they clearly had more staff then they needed because the weather kept people off the patio, which is why many people will go to this restaurant (its close to the river and enjoys nice views and a large fountain next to it).  So, we went there on Mother's Day and they had several tables open but said that they were not serving dinner and that we could sit at bar until a table was ready.  I thought this was strange since there were several empty tables we could see from the entrance and there people eating what appeared to be dinner food.  I shrugged this off and I then said to the hostess, \\"do you need our name?\\" and the hostess acted like that was a novel idea and then wrote our names down first on her list.\\n\\nMy mom ordered a drink and I had a lemonade at the bar while my wife had a glass of water.  After a while, other people showed up and were seated at 4 person tables, and we were ignored.  Finally, I went up to the hostess and asked if there was a table available (there were two empty tables in view and one table had just been seated), and for whatever reason she looked hesitant before saying there was a table for us.  \\n\\nWe walked across the dining room and saw at least half of the tables empty.  It was around 3:30, so it was an in between time, and it was strange that they would not seat us if there were so many tables empty (they did not all fill up while we ate so it was not like they were all reserved either!)  We were seated and waited at least 10 minutes and no waiter showed up to offer us water or bread or appetizer.  I had to call the manager over who was moving chairs nearby and ask if we could get a server.  I was kind of irritated that he was paying more attention to chairs then to his customers, but when he came over he apologized and got a server and told us that he would get us an appetizer.  Our understanding was that it would be free, and the waiter was there when he said this I believe, but we were still charged for it.  We didn't really want an appetizer and decided if it was free we would just get one. I did not want to make a scene when I received the bill because i was so upset with the service, so I just paid and left and didn't mention this to anyone.  \\n\\nOverall, what was supposed to be a nice mother's day meal was not as enjoyable due to the very bad service at this restaurant.  Of course I enjoyed the company I was with, but I got so mad thinking that they clearly could see I was with my mother on Mother's Day and they made us feel like we did not matter.  \\n\\nFinally, the food was not great either; the steak I had was cooked right, but the sauce on it was not good and the potatoes and vegetables looked poorly presented and didn't taste very good.  It was disappointing.  The other dishes were fine, but nothing to write home about.

It's not because service was super slow but simply due to limited seating.\\n\\nThe process to this ramen shop is pretty simple: get in line, order, they'll give you a number, and then you poach for seats. You can't simply just walk in and sit down already. They will ask you to stand up until you have a number from the front. So don't be rude while others are ordering and waiting for their seats.\\n\\nOnce seated with your number, your order will come out soon. There's usually not a long wait so no worries there.\\n\\nNow for the food. I would recommend grabbing their Katsu Munchie Slider (I think that's the name....) and their Mi-So-Hot. Pretty delicious. Also get their Tonkotsu Sho-Yu. I wouldn't recommend their Tsukemen though (will explain afterwards). \\n\\nKatsu Munchie Slider seems to be the best appetizer here because it is truly delicious. If you look at every table, there's usually a slider or two but for $4 it's kind of expensive for the portion you're getting.\\n\\nTheir gyoza on the other hand, not my cup of tea. Didn't taste like they made it in shop because the dumpling \\"skin\\" was very chewy and the filling was very \\"condensed\\" as you would find in a frozen box at any asian supermarket.\\n\\nTonkotsu Sho-Yu is the upgraded version of their Original Tonkotsu Ramen that tastes better with more added stuff. Highly recommend. The chashu is very tender and full of flavor of goodness. Soft boiled egg with the yolk slightly undercook. Mmmmm. I also love the bamboo shoots.\\n\\nMi-So-Hot broth appeals to me more personally. It's a different flavor from the usual ramen so for me, I truly like it. Can't really describe it so try it for yourself.\\n\\nThe ramen noodle tastes like something that didn't come out of a bag to me so they probably made them in shop. Pretty soft and delicate. I like it.\\n\\nTsukemen. Hmmm I wanted to truly love it but the noodles for this dish is different. Broth was really good. Very close to Mi-So-Hot but with something like lime added I believe. The noodle was cooked to al-dente and didn't taste that great. When you dipped it into the broth, it didn't hold the flavor well. So no good.\\n\\nFinally my dessert was a Mango Mochi and dear god, that mochi was the most delicious mochi I had ever have. I usually get those frozen ones in the market and they pale in comparison.

This is perhaps one of the most recognized and hailed music venues not just in Texas, but across the country.  This review is for my Dallas friends and those who have never experienced music here.\\n\\nStubbs BBQ is billed as both a restaurant and music venue (and of course a retail BBQ sauce), but as the years gone by, the food has become a byproduct taking a backseat to Stubbs' concert events.\\n\\nIt is comprised of an outdoor amphitheater (known as Waller Creek Outdoor Amphitheater) and a smaller indoor club stage.  The outdoor amphitheater is medium-small in size and capacity.  It is standing room only, general admission.  Most concerts will occur out here, barring inclement weather.\\n\\n1. The sound quality is incredible and that would be credit to both Stubbs and the sound crew for the Artist performing.  No matter where you are standing inside Stubbs, you ALWAYS have a good view of the stage. Like most amphitheaters, the grounds from the stage to the rear are on an incline that rises to the rear and declines towards the stage.  Stubbs is one of the FEW places that I know of where you could be at a big name national act and move yourself to the front row, back to the concessions to grab a beer and mingle with your buds and go right back to the front row to keep rocking without ANY security personnel stopping you or hassling you at all.\\n\\n2. Drinks are priced pretty steep for your downtown Austin fare ($7 for a big Miller High Life, $9 for a Bud Lite or Shiner, $3 for a bottled water.)\\n\\n3. Restrooms are comprised of a row of Porto-Potties that are unisex.  (This is the one of the few times I ever feel sorry for the Ladies and their restroom woes.  Really sorry.)\\n\\n4. And parking:  You're in the jungle, baby.  Budget $10 - $12 for this and familiarize yourself as much as possible in \\"the ways of Downtown-Austin-Parking\\" if you haven't already.\\n\\nThere is absolutely no parking at the venue unless you are Stubbs personnel, band/ crew or one of the \\"chosen ones.\\"  You will be relying on pay-to-park lots scattered across the downtown area or just luck in general.  However, if you're show is on a weeknight, you'll still have to pay to park (on average $5 - $8) but it will be significantly less hassle and you should be able to find a spot close by if not directly across the street.  \\n\\nThe only time you would ever pay $20 or more for parking would be during SXSW, and that is a WHOLE 'nother can of beans...\\n\\nThis place only needed an introduction, no conclusion necessary.  I think you get it.\\n\\n\\n**But last, Captain Steven's 'lil sweet piece of intel.  Take notes, kids:\\n\\nIf you've bought tickets to a show at Stubbs and happened a BIG or HUGE FAN of the artist or band, here is how you MIGHT get a chance to meet them, take a picture with them and/ or get an autograph.  \\n\\nHang out at the \\"Load-In\\" on 8th street anywhere from 4-6 hours prior to the doors opening (not show start-time, door open-time) and wait for the crews with the trucks to get there.  Trust me, you won't miss them.  Usually the band crew will arrive to the venue and setup the day of the show.  It is rare that they arrive and setup the day before at a venue like Stubbs.  \\n\\nPlay it cool and don't bum-rush them, but observe carefully and wait for the band to either come out of a truck, or get dropped off from a van or such shortly after the crews arrived and begun setting up (this could be between 1-2 hours after the crews arrive.)  At that point, position yourself close by and wait for an opportune moment to approach the band casually and greet them.  After that, everything else is fate and destiny.  Hopefully you will get your \\"brush-of-greatness\\" followed by an awesome show.  No guarantees, but it's worth a shot if you're in the area and have the time.  I merely provide instructions on taking this 'shot.'"},{"name":"No Mas!

We told her we would be sitting at the bar and took our seats.\\n\\nWe waited for a very long time for the bartender (and there was only 2 other people sitting at the bar at the time) to take our order. Someone brought out chips and salsa. The salsa tasted like it was drenched in black pepper. It was horrific. After we finally were able to speak to the bartender, she brought us horribly overpriced bloody marys that tasted EXACTLY like the salsa. You guys know the rule: Do not waste alcohol, no matter what. Guzzle it down if you have to, right? I could not finish it. I can honestly say that I have never had a worse mixed drink in my life. \\n\\nI remember taking the first sip and being so dumbfounded by the taste that I had to turn my head away from the drink. As I did this, I saw the hostess texting behind the hostess stand, slouched over so that no one could see her. Mind you, there were people waiting to be seated and looking around for a hostess just as we were moments before. Too bad they had to wait longer because the hostess was having a very important conversation via text. \\n\\nThat girl was beyond rude and had no customer service skills whatsoever.

In general, the best description I can give is bland. From the chips to the salsa (you might normally call this pico), to the fish taco, everything seemed under seasoned and lacking balance.

The place has a dark color scheme with wood detail and red ambient lighting. It is strange though that they give you cloth napkins and theres candles lit on the tables but you eat with those disposable wooden take out chop sticks.

The sweet and sour sauce tasted like it was homemade or altered which I appreciated as it was not the stuff found in take-out packets. When we got to our spicy chicken it was overwhelmingly salty and the bottom of the bowl had a huge pool of soy sauce, like 1/3 a cup. No one is supposed to use that much soy sauce on a single dish. Since I was hungry and tired I basically just shook off the sauce from each piece of chicken. There was also no trace of any peppers or spiciness even though it was supposed to be spicy chicken. The lions head meatball buns were not bad and come with 3 per order. The bun was nice and fluffy and they came with some cabbage in each bun (random factoid: the cabbage is the lions mane and the meat is the lions head). They were a little salty also but not as bad as the chicken. Our painkiller drink was quite tasty with a healthy amount of liquor. I enjoyed the dash of cinnamon and nutmeg that mixed with the pineapply goodness. \\n\\nOur service was very attentive however they overcharged us for the drink. They fixed it though after it was brought to their attention. I was unsure about asking about the ginormous amount of soy sauce in our dish as I felt like a place that sells crab rangoon as traditional chinese fare may think that that was normal.

It seems like they were using rice flour or tempura or something. It was just wrong. Waffles were not a nice texture either. They should be soft on the inside but crunchy enough on the outside to hold up to the syrup and chicken. Sweet potato waffles are just too soggy. We tried a few things there and they all fell short.

Great!\\nI asked for a grilled chicken sandwich and my daughter got a burger. The chicken was rancid/rotten. I spit out the bite I took, it was disgusting. I called the waitress over and told her. She looked surprised and asked if I just wanted the salad bar- NO, I am hungry yet. So I got a hamburger and asked for it to be almost well done but with a little pink in the middle. Quite a bit of time passed but finally the burger arrived. \\nSo well done, that both sides were crispy. I picked enough meat out of half of it and gave up.\\nThe strawberry lemonade we usually like tasted like it was made of plastic this time, so we didn't drink much of that, either.\\nThey did adjust the bill, thankfully.\\nBut.

Then we ordered the \\"hungry like a wolf\\" to split between us, and to our surprise the kitchen split it for us bringing us equal amount on our own separate plates. And we also ordered the four snacks as well. Between the two items we had plenty to eat.  And because I saw banana pudding on the menu for desserts, I absolutely had to order it as well plus a chocolate cake that was bigger that the plate. Not disappointed in any way. I have not had banana pudding since I left home Ions ago so I want s to see if an old tradition could have changed over to years and to my surprise it still tasted like it did 40 years ago and the chocolate cake was enough for 4 people.

Went here last week after reading all of the great reviews. The aesthetics of the place leave something to be desired. (That said, if the food would have been amazing, I wouldn't even bringing this up.) From the outside, the place looks like a dive bar covered in neon beer signs. The inside is lit completely in red light, throwing off your sense of color and quick frankly lowering your expectations. For patrons who aren't used to dining this type of setting, I'm sure many walked away without even going in...\\n\\nThe food. We ordered a rib sandwich, chopped pork sandwich, and sides of mac 'n' cheese & brunswick stew. When I think BBQ, I think large portions. The \\"sides\\" were the same size are those 1/4 c. plastic containers you'd use to get a side of cream cheese at the bagel shop, i.e. a few bites. The mac 'n' cheese was terrible. The brunswick stew was good. Larger sides, please! \\n\\nThe main source of confusion was the rib sandwich. It was three ribs, bone-in, in between two pieces of Miracle-style white bread. No BBQ sauce. No cole slaw. Nada. Literally... ribs in between white bread with the bones STILL THERE. Sooo.. how are you supposed to eat this without breaking a tooth? My husband had to take the whole thing apart, strip the rib meat of the bones and basically remake the whole sandwich on what was now soggy dumb bread.  A really lazy sammy, if you ask me. \\n\\nThe chopped pork sandwich was good but quite small.

The food was fine, but because I myself have worked at three restaurants and enjoy cooking, I felt some of the items we ordered were below par and tells me there are some inexperienced cooks in their kitchen. My son had the Peanut Wrap, which came to our table blackened. At first we thought it was Cajun seasoning, but no, the tortilla wrap had been toasted until it was ashes. My husband ordered the Surf and Turf (steak with prawns and scallops which were teeny tiny) for $24. It tasted like frozen rather than fresh. This entree made my husband so sick that he had to stay home from work the next day. Also, I was thinking of Black Angus steak dinners for half the price and better quality and thinking, \\"rip off!\\" My husband does have a sensitive stomach, but I think the garlic mashed potatoes made him ill. If you stir in a lot of raw garlic into your potatoes without roasting them first, you will have a lot of bloated, painful gas. A good cook would have roasted the garlic first. Also, the Balsamic salad dressing came to him in a cup and had the consistency of pudding, rather than a liquid. This was weird. I think if you stick with the pub style items, you will be fine. My Taco Trio was delish and a good value for $11. I don't like the coated french fries here. I think it must be coated with salt and corn starch or something, but it made the fries too salty and thus, a less healthful choice. Fries are so good they really can stand on their own without this coating which is really gimmicky.

No doubt you've noticed the change of ownership signs on a rather out-of-place buillding called Cafe 101. A round edifice, with dome roof, it's completely unlike the majority of ramshackle buildings that line Buford Hwy.  Whether this building would meet earthquake-prone Los Angeles building codes is doubtful, but it's certainly different enough to attract attention.\\n\\nUpon entry, the visitor will be greeted by the strains of T-pop.  That is, Taiwanese pop.  Sappy and sentimental oftentimes, it immediately lends a sense of authenticity to an esablishment that purports to be Taiwanese in ownership, flavour and verve.  If this is what you're looking for, look no further.  \\n\\nEarlier this year, I'd complained that Bento-Cafe was the only Taiwanese establishment here in ATL...  Cafe 101 has not only joined its ranks, but has truly outdone its competition.\\n\\nIf you're eating here, don't go for the standard Taiwanese cafeteria combo-meals, go for the full flavoured stuff on ttheir menu.  May I suggest the one Hakka styled dish, the \\"mei cai zhu rou\\".  Mei vegetable pork.  It's nuts.  Not for everyone, especially since the primary seasoning doesn't really exist outside of Chinese menus, but it's an ingredient that the initiated not only know well, but crave.\\n\\nThe flavour of that spice is a tad reminiscent of Chinese medicine -- but the slightly bitter tang of the spice serves as a wonderful contrast to the garlic, onion and soy that also season the rich, lipid laden pork that forms the primary substance of the dish.  Personally, I love using the gravy on the rice... and then can eat bowl after bowl after bowl.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the rice is probably my primary complaint.  I couldn't tell what brand of rice they use here, but the texture was off.  We think it as a tad overcooked -- but I wasn't sure.  A little stifff, and not sticky enough for my preferences.  Perhaps it was just the batch of rice cooked.\\n\\nThe Mapo tofu was also quite a treat. It's a standard test dish for me (Thanks Fong L.  I learned a lot from you ...), and I think they do this dish competently.  I've had better, but this Mapo tofu is solid. I wouldn't mind a bit more numbing peppercorn, but that's another story. A couple Shanghainese style dishes are present -- We had the Tofu version, which rocked.  The nian gao (Thick Rice Noodle), Taro, mushrooms and chinese sausage within were cooked to just the appropriate level of tenderness -- and the seasonings were flavourful, yet not overwhelming...  I also didn't get stung by overuse of msg.\\n\\nMilk tea is available in dozens of combinations, as well as shaved ice.  All of which appear decent in quality.\\n\\nIf you're expecting oyster pancakes, Tian-bu-la, intestines and kidney dishes -- look elsewhere -- in the world.  This place isn't a heavy, heavy taiwanese small dish haven.  It rather contains a melange of Chinese continental dishes prepared with Taiwanese verve, taiwanese hospitality and taiwanese ambiance.  It feels like a diner for the casual diner in a less ritzy part of Taipei.  And I wouldn't mind a lot more places like this in Atlanta.\\n\\nIn fact, I told one of my fellow diners that the meal made me want to stay in Atlanta.  :)\\n\\n4+/5 for quality (Solid Solid food, but you won't go mad with delight)\\nBut best of breed in Atlanta.  - half a star.\\n\\n5 out of 5\\n\\nEva - I hope you go back here soon, cuz I'm going to have to disagree this time..  :)"},{"name":"The Squealing Pig","address":"134 Smith St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"If I still lived in Mission Hill, I would probably make this my regular spot (second to Flann's, which WAS my regular spot back in the day).

While driving around downtown in Austin, for the first time ever, I decided to drive by out of sheer morbid curiosity and hunger for the mythological brisket that he painstakingly tends around the clock. I stopped because the line wasn't too bad. When I got there, it was 10:58. Within 20 or so minutes the young lady came out and let the back of the line (me included) was not guaranteed to get meat. But by this point, I was involved in the experience and the comeraderie of standing in line with fellow race fans and a couple of Bostonians. This is half of the Franklin experience. 99% of the people behind me had left, with the exception of a young couple from Chicago that came out for the race as well. The young lady came back from inside selling beverages to us in line. They featured Big Red and Mexican Coke. Awesome. So our group was steadfast in our BBQ endeavour. About 4 people in front of me, she came back again and posted the Sold Out signs on the doors, but assured us that we would be able to get at least some turkey or sausage. We didn't care, come hell or highwater, we were going to get something from this place. Inside its warm and smells of smoked meats. Everyone inside is smiling; and the man behind the meat is there to greet you for your options. NOT ONLY did we get meat, we got BRISKET. The same Brisket they assured us we would not get. What Franklin described as 'Scrappy' was not only heaven in Beef form, but we got a deal that you wouldn't believe. Me and the Chicagoans decided to combine forces and we got Lemon Chess' Brisket, Texas Toast, and Sausage. Which cost us a total of 8$. We paid for our Tipsy Texans (Chopped Beef and Sausage on a soft bun with Slaw) which were 8$. Our perserverance paid off in the form of about 2lbs of free BBQ. And the BBQ we wanted and came for as well. By the time I departed, it was 2:00. Thats a total of 3 hours. And worth EVERY second of waiting. This is the Barbecue that Texas is famous for. The smoke ring is uniform and consistent. The meat is unequivocally tender and falls apart with a mere glance. His BBQ sauces are rich and vinegary and only compliment the meat in a way that instantly makes you salivate. It is astounding. I will not only be back here when I come back to Austin, I would make a trip to Austin just so I could bring others. So for those of you that say it's anything but exceptional, and complain about his business model, we should all be so enterprising and determined to do something different. And make it a success. Good for you, Franklin, and thank you for the hospitality and quality that makes Texas historical and proud to be what it is.\\n\\nBy far, my favorite BBQ in anywhere. Better than Rendezvous and Interstate in Memphis, better than Salt Lick, Stubbs or Iron Works here in Austin. Better than Pecos in Seattle. He has made meat the centerpiece of unity in Austin. Being in line with a smile on your face, while interacting with those around you.

First of all you can't compare the two restaurants other than it's the same owner/ chef Kevin Gillespie.  I knew that going in.  I also knew that Revival hasn't been open very long and it takes all restaurants a while to find themselves.  It's very possible Revival keeps on improving and makes it's way from 4 to 5 star territory.  Right now, their 4 star rating is about right.\\n\\nI joined 3 other friends for their Family Style Dinner, which is a great way to try the menu.  Each person picks their own entree and later a dessert.  Everything else is served family style to share and is picked for you by the restaurant. Our meal started off with Toasted Deviled Ham Tea Sandwiches.  These were just ok and we seemed to be more interested in the pickled veggies in the middle of the plate.  3 stars.\\n\\nNext up was the well yelped about Kale Salad.  It was apple season, so while most photos on yelp are showing peaches, they were replaced with apples on our salad.  Some green apples were sliced very thin which gave it the texture of a lettuce leaf.  However it was the thicker sliced red apple slices that got us talking.  These apples are marinated in maraschino cherry juice, which gave it an interesting candy like sweet flavor.  This went well with the slightly bitter kale, savory parmesan like cheese, and tangy boiled dressing.  5 stars\\n\\nThe cornbread was well received by all, very buttery and moist with extra butter to slather on.  These are done in an iron skillet, so the corn bread has a nice golden brown crust on each side.  5 stars\\n\\nI have to say I was disappointed in the size of the fried chicken entree.  My plan was to split 2 entrees with my friend in order to try each.  We were told the Chicken portion was 1/3rd of a chicken.  Huh?  Chicken comes in quarters, and it comes in halves, but it doesn't come in thirds.  But sure enough it showed up with 2 wings and a thigh.  A very strange mix, and I think it's potluck to what pieces of chicken you are actually going to get.  People are picky about their chicken, some like all white, some like all dark, some like a mix.  But very few people want to be served 2 wings out of 3 pieces of chicken.  These were also tiny pieces of chicken, as the breasts and thighs were about the same size as a drumstick.  It could be that they are chopping each breast into 2 pieces.  If you are ordering a la carte, then the chicken is fairly priced at $13.  Just raise the price to $16 and give people a half a chicken.  1 breast, 1 wing, 1 thigh, 1 drumstick.  The last thing you want is jealous customers looking at other plates of fried chicken, thinking \\"what?  they got 2 drumsticks and a breast!  I got screwed!\\"  And trust me, we were doing just that seeing nicer plates of chicken than ours coming out.  The result of all this; I only got to try 1 chicken wing, and it was a tease.  I think it might have been great, but I didn't taste enough to know.  It was a shame.. ? Stars\\n\\nI went with the Beef & Pork Meatloaf wrapped in bacon.  It was very good and when they say wrapped in bacon, they mean it.  Not just one slice of bacon, but the entire meatloaf is wrapped in bacon, so you'll get plenty of bacon with each bite.  The meatloaf itself was tasty and was topped with pickled onions, which added a little tang against the savory meatloaf.  This is a large slice of a larger meatloaf, about 5\\" x 3\\".  I cut off about 1/3rd of it to trade for that tiny little chicken wing.  I gambled and lost and yes a few weeks later I'm still bitter about it.  4 stars\\n\\n5 side dishes, or trimmings as they like to say in the South, were brought out all at once to share. Perhaps the most interesting was the Lemon Glazed Sweet Potatoes.  Nice slabs of sweet potato with a lemon glaze on it - 5 stars.  Stone Ground grits and caramelized onions, tasted exactly like a cipollini caramelized onion dip, the grits were almost an after thought - 4 stars.  The Hickory Smoked Local Greens were larger pieces rather than your usual chopped up mushy greens - 4 stars.  The Roasted turnips with apples was tasty and very seasonal - 4 stars.  The Sweet Young Carrots with Dill were my least favorite side, as they were only lightly cooked and quite crunchy still. - 2.5 stars.  \\n\\nSomething that was missing, that I was really looking forward to...the mac 'n cheese.   When I realized that no mac 'n cheese was going to be served, I requested some and they happily brought us out a portion at no extra charge.  It was excellent and I'm glad I spoke up.  I wouldn't come here without getting some. It's topped with salted kettle chips for a little extra crunch.  Take that - breadcrumbs!!! 5 stars\\n\\nAll 4 desserts were delicious, with my favorite being the Pineapple Upside Down Cake with Dr. Pepper Ice Cream.  It seems desserts change often, so don't fall in love.  Revival should be on your to do list, just get your own fried chicken and save the sharing for sides."},{"name":"Tatte Bakery & Cafe","address":"70 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic food and pastries in a great location. It's gets crowded, but right around the corner there's a church (?) with large stone steps that serve as a wonderful picnic spot, where our group of six was happy to relax. I had their special - short ribs grilled cheese with beets and horse radish (so good!) and a pear tart (truly divine!). Others were equally pleased with their food, and we passed around our deserts for everyone to try. So I also tried the no-bake blueberry cheesecake, the pistachio tart, pain-au-chocolate, and a cinnamon roll. Everything was delicious, with cheesecake and the pistachio tart standing out as especially good (there's so much pistachios in the tart, and the whole thing has a flavor that's mildly reminiscent of baklava).

I would suggest going on a weekday if possible but the wait is apart of the experience!\\n\\nFinally if you're traveling or just want to take a chunk of brisket home, I would suggest buying the vacuumed sealed and chilled brisket (that comes with a free bottle of sauce). They run between 4-5 lbs and come with reheating instructions.

However, something odd happened last night that I thought I should warn other guests against. \\nAt the end of our meal, our server collected my friends' credit card, processed it into their computer and then brought the usual merchant/client version. But, we were then brought an old school etched version with my friend's full credit card information and was asked to sign and leave that version behind as well. It was very odd since the computerized transaction had been completed- their computer was not down. My friend is a server at another restaurant and was very uncomfortable leaving behind a version with her credit card details.

Words are Profanity, a corruption of True Thought, a product of that detestable beast, Man. To encapsulate the divine in the prosaic quasimatter of language is to pervert it.\\n\\nBut alas, so goes Dirty Frank's because while it may be the closest thing to a church I go to, and while it may very well be steeped in The Spirit, it is after all just a modest hot dog joint slash bar that just happens to be probably the best restaurant in the world.\\n\\nI mention Dirty Frank's to basically anyone who will listen. When friends visit from afar, the first place I take them in Columbus is Dirty Frank's- sometimes even before I let them step foot in my home. When I don't know what to eat, I go to Dirty Frank's, and when I know what I want to eat, it's often Dirty Frank's. \\n\\nI have tried a LOT of their dogs and not a single one has raised a single qualm for me EXCEPT perhaps, that it is not three times larger and stapled to a $20 bill. But I suppose realistically, this is a roster of creative, delicious, wallet-saavy hot dogs that show Columbus quirk, Ohio charm, and food nirvana. \\n\\nBUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!\\n\\nHot dogs are, of course, wicked good. We know this. But did you know Dirty Frank's has the BEST. BEST. BEST. tater tots pretty much ever? They make you cry like a shamed dog for ever thinking those soggy, crumbly pasty things of elementary school were delicious. THESE are tater tots the likes of which Sonic marketing execs must stay blissfully ignorant to stave off a certain fate of suicide.\\n\\nAdd in the big plates like chili mac and the Octodog and sides like the aforementioned tots, GREAT onion rings, and fried leeks (mmmm), and you have a deep-fried comfort-food \\"gourmet-\\"hot dog meal fit for not only a king, but fit also for the divine spirit that came down from heaven to invest in that king the proper authority to own thousands of human beings as feudal property. No, this is not hyperbole people. I'm being modest.\\n\\nThen there's the full bar, the great drinks with names that are just goofy enough to go past awful into truly, credibly, funnycool, the FUNNEL CAKE FRIES, the fact that they only play local music, the Frost-Top Root Beer on TAP, the great art from Liz Lessner's brother on the walls, the tiny-bar atmosphere, the lively crowd, the good-lookin', straight-shootin' waitstaff, etc. etc. and you have THE destination in Columbus for everything I should ever, for legal reasons, admit to needing or wanting.\\n\\nAnd THEN, and THEN my friends, I can mention Dirtyoke, the Costume Karaoke EXTRAVAGANZA that KJ Dirtyoke throws every Monday starting at, what, 9pm or so. It's always a blast, it draws a fairly stable cast of great regulars, and it's the lamb's titties in general. You should probably go this Monday because you don't want to be a lame clown weiner.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I like Dirty Frank's. The entire place is the heroin that calms the little William S. Burroughs in my stomach. Where's the six-star review option?!

But, I had to re-evaluate my rating after having a less than stellar meal following a really good one.\\n\\nI ate here for the first time a few days ago on a viciously cold day in Atlanta. I loved the d√©cor and the beautiful servers. The menu really caught my attention because it was so unique - frankfurters (choice of Italian sausage, kielbasa or a beef frank); pork burgers; corndogs (who knew you could get one with a peppered batter?); fries or tots; boiled peanuts; and a chicken salad sandwich. That is about it. The drink menu is something else - shakes, egg creams, malts, cider, and a lot of make your own drink concoctions.\\n\\nI had the spiced cider (alcohol free though apparently I could have added a cinnamon fireball to it), which was so damn good. I also tried a corndog with the beef frank and peppered batter and everything was really tasty. I got the Midway to go, which is very close to the iconic Chicago treat of an Italian beef but with a polish sausage and hot peppers. You can also get your frankfurter ripped (char marks), grilled (on a Panini press) or my favorite, charred. Delightful.\\n\\nThat meal was amazing. But I visited again on Thanksgiving and was disappointed. I got the Thanksgiving Special, which was a massive roast turkey leg, mashed potatoes, gravy and collared greens. I really didn't like the meal at all. The turkey tasted weird - it looked like turkey, but tasted like a lamb shank. Very strange. The potatoes, gravy and greens were okay, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nAfter experiencing such a wonderful meal the first time, I was really disappointed with my second meal. I am not going to go to the lengths some other Yelpers are saying about this being the best new restaurant in Atlanta, but it is one of my new favorites and I want to visit a few more times before anointing this place \\"the spot.\\""},{"name":"Holy Smoke Barbecue","address":"5251 N Hamilton Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"After reading earlier reviews, I was a little wary of what I'd find here, but since it's right up the street from my office, and I had a BBQ itch, I figured it couldn't hurt.\\n\\nAnd it didn't!\\n\\nThe service was amazing.

The only sauces that were \\"runny\\" were the hot sauces, which were presented in the same style bottles as Tabasco and the like, and were obviously intended to not be thick.  I personally decided to drizzle the Sweet & Smoky and Chipotle sauces on my meat, with a hit of the Habenero.  I win.\\n\\nMy partner ordered pork shoulder and fries, and I had the Loaded Cave Chips with brisket.  Of course, we sampled each other's dishes, and everything was impressive.  The chips and fries are heartily seasoned with a delicious blend that reminds me of how BBQ chips used to taste, back before flavour became a chemical blend.  The meat was soft and juicy and charred in the right places.  I didn't notice ANY fat on my brisket, just the tenderness that told me it was cooked right.\\n\\nThe cheese sauce on the chips was a thick, creamy, homemade blend of love and yum.\\n\\nIf I was to have one complaint, it would be that the meat was a little on the cooler side, temperature-wise.

Zabu looked like the best option out of the bunch, but we were hesitant since it had some negative reviews about the service. \\n\\nWe ate at Zabu on a Monday night around 8pm and found the whole place packed.

We opted for a pitcher of Sapporo and two different types of wings: the soy ones and the hot ones. \\n\\nOur Sapporo arrived first with some radish appetizer and plates, but the chicken took a bit of time to come out. However, when it did, it did not disappoint. The chicken was hot, with great texture (a bit of a crunch), spices, and tenderness. The only disappointing part was not having enough chicken. The Sapporo beer was perfect to cool our mouths down for the \\"hot\\" chicken wings, which were pretty spicy in my opinion but so delicious. \\n\\nWe ended up ordering another order of those \\"hot\\" wings.

I moved to Columbus Ohio about six months ago and have not had pizza delivered yet. I know it sounds strange but those who know me are aware of my Pizza demands. As Dewey's or Troni's in Dayton are the only places i go to in Ohio. Both do not deliver and Troni's is 80 miles away. So I take a few spins on my itouch urbanspoon app and up pops a place called bonopizza it is only 4.2 miles away and I have never seen it. So the wife and I jump in the car. They do not deliver but I want to see it so I punch the address in the Tom Tom and head out. I pass the place a few times and don't see it. I pull into a Donato's parking lot and call the place for directions but I figure it must be out of business. They answer the phone and tell me it is in the back of a Liquor store. OK this has to suck but I got to see a Pizza place in a Liquor store so I proceed the block down the road and pull in the lot. \\n  \\nSome guy is standing in between a door that says bonotogo with a phone number and the dumpster having a smoke and I ask him if this is the entrance. He politely says no but come on in anyway. I walk in the door only to face the fire of the wood burning pizza oven at full tilt behind the counter. The Wife and I walk around it and sit down at one of the two tables. One seats 6 which has a reserved sign on it while the other is only for two. Set on the tables are several vintage cookbooks for the eight potential customers to read. There is also a vintage 1970's push button phone on the table for two. \\n  \\nA gentleman between 50 and 60 comes out of a back room and greets us politely wearing a Captians Hat and tell us that the phone is for use to call anyone if we want even to call enemies or prank calls. I like this guy. A woman of about the same age appears and hands us a menu. To my back is a Liquor store through a walkway. She asks if we had been there before and we reply no we found you on the internet. She explains that they opened a month ago and serve fresh made pizza in an oven invented by her husband. From what i saw on the way in it appears to be a precast unit surrounded in stucco. It has a black pipe running up through the center of the ceiling with a drop ceiling in need of repair. She also tells of of there travels around Ohio, tells us if we wish to take home any of the cookbooks on the tables and return them at a later date it would be fine. My Wife and her spend some time talking about old cookbooks as I have about 4 or 5 hundred myself. \\n  \\nTo the Pizza. She tells me that all the ingredients are fresh and never frozen. Pizza is made to order and makes a few recommendations. We opt for the #18 Carbonara the description reads: Smithfield peppered ham/bacon is caramelized for three hours with a ton of onions then put on a layer of Asiago and fresh mozzarella cheeses then sprinkled with parmesan and pixie dust and gorgonzola. I also order a Pepperoni #14: an American Classic and she recommends adding fresh sausage. \\nI ask about beverages and she says to purchase anything I want from the store attached. I go over and buy a 24 oz Miller original in a can and return to my seat. While the first Pizza is in the oven she brings over two tiny plastic champagne glasses for our beverage and a photo book of the history of bono pizza and his patented oven. We chat for awhile and our pizza is delivered from the oven maybe seven feet away. The #18 Carbonara is delivered to the table piping hot with a warning to let it cool a little. So I have 1 sip out of my shot glass of beer refill it and dig in. Perfectly cooked and delicious. The 10 inch kind of round crust is perfect. It needs nothing. My wife is speechless. By the time we both finish a piece the pepperoni arrives. It is also just as good and the sausage she recommended is better than the pepperoni. \\nI have found Pizza Nirvana in a Liquor Store from a Man in a Captains Hat next to a Dumpster. I kinda hope that this place sort of stays a secret but I also think they might need the business. These people know how to make Pizza so I doubt it. If you are in the area you must stop in and say hi to these fun and amazing people. They are only opened from 5pm to 10pm. I dont think they deliver but I could be wrong. The Pizza is $10 dollars each and you can order them anyway you want. The two pizzas were $20 plus the $1.48 24oz beer for a total of $21.48 it was a steal and one of the most enjoyable meals I have ever had...Russ \\n  \\nOn the menu it says: \\n  \\nof course its in the back of a liquor store its bono pizza.

When entering, go in the larger section on the right, or you'll be eating in China Bucks, which strangely had only Hispanic people going in and out on a Saturday afternoon.  We were promptly seated and offered drinks by a friendly woman with sufficient command of English.  In fact, all the employees we encountered communicated effectively in English.  The buffet is fairly compact, consisting of two tables, plus another for soups and plates.  The food was pretty much split between familiar Chinese offerings (sesame chicken, General Tso's chicken, . . . ) and new things like tofu, pig's feet, and a fish dish with beans.  Rice and lo mein noodles were served at the buffet, while steamed rice was brought to the table in a covered dish.  Some highlights:  the basil chicken, the tofu dish with red chili peppers, and potstickers.  My inability to match sauces to dishes was a bit annoying, but I probably should have asked.  The dishes seem to change almost as often as they empty out, so the labels on the tables are not always correct.  When at our table, we were not offered forks, so we provided comic relief to the Asian customers with our improvised chopstick technique.\\n\\nAll the food was well-prepared and satisfying.  The piped-in Chinese lounge singer music was a little loud, but somehow it fit the converted 1970's  bank decor in a way I cannot explain.  The Saturday crowd was mostly Asian, indicating (to me) that the food is authentic and appreciated by those who know the difference.  With two people drinking water, and a pretty good tip (for a buffet, anyway), we still spent only $19.00.  The food did not \\"wow\\" us, but it was definitely good and for the money, a good value.

Everyone kept raving about the fried chicken here, which is totally valid, but they should be raving about ALL the food.\\n\\nThe Fried Chicken ($14.75) is not as herby as other places (which I also like) but there's a lot of flavor in the oil.  It's fried perfectly because even the white meat is very tender.  The sides included collard greens and mashed potatoes.  Collard greens were not chopped up but left in big leafy pieces and also cooked perfectly.  The stems were very edible with no resistance.  Mashed potatoes were well, just really mashed and smooth potatoes, but the gravy was the more chunky standout item as it was ham based.\\n\\nNow I really did not want my husband to order the Pork and Beans ($14.75) because whenever we get pork (any part but the ribs) at Southern restaurants, it is most of the time dry, even if just a little.  This piece of pork shoulder was so tenderly cooked that I could break it apart easily with just my fork.  I thought the sides of hock stewed beans and spicy slaw would be on the side but the pork and spicy slaw actually rest on top of a thin layer of large beans on the plate.  It all works perfectly when eaten together.  And I was pleasantly surprised that the slaw was actually spicy... it offsets the sweetness of the molasses nicely.\\n\\nMacaroni and Cheese side ($5.25) is a portion for two mainly and is a better take on a the homemade style.  I'm not sure what cheese they use but it is white and creamy, and stays creamy for the entire meal.  The top has been covered in some cheddar and baked to a nice crispiness.  \\n\\nAs you can see, the prices are very reasonable for this kind of food, especially considering how outstanding the quality and taste are.

We've had ramen back in Washington, Tokyo, and South Korea. \\n\\nWe arrived at 11:25a.m. on a Friday and were in line for ten minutes before ordering. Once we reached the counter, all the employees we encountered from then on out were super friendly and personable. I went with a veggie ramen with added fish cake and an egg, my husband opted for the shoyu, and we also ordered the tsukemen dipping ramen to share. Unfortunately, we found the drinks to be very highly priced: $3 dollars for a Mexican coke and $4.25 for a basil lemonade, so we decided to stick with water. A lemonade shouldn't be half the cost of a bowl of ramen. \\n\\nI was worried that the communal seating would prove to be awkward and uncomfortable, but each station is nicely separated by a napkin dispenser and spoon and chopstick holders. The music is extremely loud, which didn't bother me, but my husband, who suffers from PTSD and hearing loss in one ear (difficulty hearing staff), hated it. \\n\\nI found the veggie ramen to be absolutely delicious. I've had tonkotsu ramen plenty of times and wanted to try something different; I was glad I did. Every topping in the veggie ramen was great, but the brussel sprouts were the star. The added egg wasn't even necessary, and I found it to be too sweet. Even if you eat meat, you should definitely give the veggie ramen a try, as I found it to be the best out of the three. \\n\\nMy husband was unimpressed by the shoyu. He didn't like that the noodles that came with it weren't the same as the ones in the veggie and tsukemen. He found the broth to be lackluster, and considering the hype this ramen shop has garnered, was expecting more. Personally, I thought the shoyu had a good porky flavor that contrasted nicely with my veggie broth. The chasu was tender, fatty, had great flavor, and according to my husband, was the best part of the ramen. \\n\\nWe both didn't really care for the dipping ramen. It was the most savory of the three, but was very reminiscent of Thai peanut sauce in mouthfeel and flavor, without actually tasting of peanuts. \\n\\nAll in all, my husband didn't find the hour drive to be worth it, but I would gladly return for the veggie ramen."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Good prices for authentic tasting Mexican and Cajun foods...very spicy, bug they serve big waters :) Their margaritas are awesome and very fairly priced, or at least they were the last time I was there a couple years ago.

There was no offer of comping the food or anything. Just a \\"You don't want the food cause it's ready now?\\" I took my money and left.

So far I've had the Shroomister omelet (shiitake, portobello, and baby mushrooms with smoked Gouda), the Naregs Malibu omelet (shiitake mushrooms, broccoli, and cheddar), and the Woofa Goofa French Toast (with ricotta, blueberries, and strawberries) and all have been excellent and delicious. \\n\\nI appreciate that there are so many omelet choices, and that they're so eclectic and creatively named.

The space is small (narrow but long). When you first walk in the bar is on your left and tables are to the back of the restaurant. There are huge windows that would let in some beautiful light during the day but at night the space is dark and moody. There is patio seating available. \\n\\nI came here for a birthday and there were a total of 5 of us so we were able to order quite a few tasty things. We stuck mainly to the appetizer and small tastes menu. I had been drinking wine earlier in the day so I switched over to beer and skipped the cocktail menu. They do have a white wine and a red wine on tap - the red is a pinot noir which is nice but very light. Their beer menu is impressive and unique. \\n\\nFor food we ordered the burger to share, pierogies, beet salad, oxtail croquettes, chicken wings, beer cheese fondue aaand... I think that's it for food. The burger was incredible  - the crispy pancetta with the creamy brie really made for a wonderful combination and their buns are slightly sweet and so fluffy. The pierogies I thought were great - I've never had one before so I have nothing to compare it to but the inside was creamy and very flavorful. The beet salad was very simple but the dressing had pistachios in it and made the salad stand out. The chicken wings were served with a lovely Thai chili sweet dipping sauce. I did not try the oxtail croquettes but everyone who did was enthusiastically happy!\\n\\nAnd then the beer cheese fondue was the winner of the night (we ended up ordering a second helping!). I love fondue any way I can get it and this was no different. The Shiner bock beer adds a slightly more bitter flavor than traditional Swiss fondue usually has and it really works. The fondue is served with toasted pretzel bread (which is such a perfect complement to the fondue) and slices of granny smith apple. The fondue doesn't come with a lot of bread or apples and so we had to ask for more to finish off the cheese. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the bag of doughnuts - it comes with several sugar coated doughnut holes and caramel dipping sauce. But it isn't the doughnuts you would get at a cheap donut house... these are denser and richer tasting. Almost like bread. It was different but very tasty and very filling. The caramel dipping sauce is soooo yummy. Surprisingly not too sweet. It was a nice touch.\\n\\nThe only criticism I can give is that the service isn't quite there yet - which is usually a side effect for new business until they get the kinks worked out. Our server asked us what beer we wanted to order twice after we had already placed the order. We had to ask two different people several times for more pretzel bread. Nothing atrocious but small things like that stand out.\\n\\nAll in all a great neighborhood option - I hope the quality of their food stays grand. I can't comment on whether or not I think it's expensive because... I don't have an opinion. It's a \\"fancy\\" gastropub. The price is appropriate for the style, the food and the new found hip coolness that Austin has lately."},{"name":"Mo Cha Tea House","address":"12520 SW Farmington Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Just yum!!

I wonder if I have the same taste buds as these people who do the 5 star reviews??!!  Maybe my taste buds are not  phased by the hype.  But if people love anything...it's stuff that's overrated.  Anyway, for what it's worth....\\n\\nHere is my 3 star review in the sea of 4 and 5 stars.   Three starts indicates A-Ok, according to Yelp..but to me it's more like...Meh...ok.  I guess if there was a rating for 2.5, it would be around there.\\n\\nIt was my birthday yesterday and the hype of this place got the better of me.  On one's birthday, it's really nice if everyone is amazed by the deliciousness and experience.  Well, I guess there is always next year...elsewhere.  Let me say this, if you want good food (and I should have just gone here in the first place) go to Country Cat.  That place is...sigh...so good (which reminds me I need to go and review them after this).\\n\\nLike another reviewer said about the Screen Door, it is southern food without a shred of southern hospitality.  Well, our host was nice.  He made it seem promising.  Our wait wasn't too long either...like a 1/2 hour.  However, our server was very efficient.  She was so efficient, in fact, that she rudely didn't allow one of my co-diners to finish what she was saying before answering.  She wasn't unfriendly...but she wasn't warm.  Very efficient though...like a cold robot.\\n\\nThe hush puppies were good and so we were hopeful.  I enjoyed the pimento cheese and crackers, probably more so than the rest of my guests.  I got a mint julep and it was nice and strong.  The food arrived quickly, which surprised me, and the plates were big.\\n\\nWhat sold me on going here was the sound of a pecan encrusted trout.  I was able to switch fingerling potatoes for a more mashed variety.  I was bummed that the seasonal veggies were squash and zucchini...as I have been eating so much of that shit from my own garden (but that's not their fault).  I took a bite of the mashed potatoes and they were pretty meh and then a bite of the fish.  I figured it was just under salted.  I threw some salt on it...bite...meh...salt...bite....meh...just a bit more salt and some pepper...and still...bland.  Pretty disappointing for a birthday meal.\\n\\nMy other co-diner got the fried chicken and she said it was good.  But I didn't hear the \\"Yumming and MMMmmming\\" that she did with the fried chicken at Country Cat.  She wasn't too impressed with their greens either.\\n\\nMy other two co-diners got the screen door plates.  Not a whole lot of yumming it up coming from those two either.  I tasted that cornbread and it was dry, bland, and kind of weird tasting.  I was told the rest of the items, like the jambalaya were not very good.   Nobody seemed particularly thrilled about any of it.  \\n\\nDidn't stay for dessert.  Was almost embarrassed that I chose this place and that no one was really impressed.  I did look at the dessert menu, and sadly, it was different than the one I had looked at online a couple days previously.  Nothing really grabbed me so I went without a birthday dessert yesterday.  Oh well.\\n\\nI think one voiced opinion from the least foodie of my co-diners  sums this experience up pretty well,  \\"Eh, it was alright but I don't think it's good enough to go back.\\""},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Food very good.

This place deserves it. \\n\\n\\nIt has kind of a hidden entrance, so you'll have to search a bit to drive in, but when you do you'll notice it. When you walk in, there's a display table with a glass cover that has fake sushi plates and other cool things to buy if you want. You'll notice a long table around a sushi conveyer belt that has sushi, fish, and dessert. You'll also see a few other tables to sit at that aren't connected to it. The conveyer belt surrounds the kitchen, where you can see them make sushi and if you're lucky, watch them sear salmon!!! Quite a cool experience. :)\\n\\nBesides the cool scenery, our server was very friendly. Cracking jokes and making us feel at home! I forgot her name, but thank you to whoever served us that day! :)\\n\\nOn the tables, there's soy sauce and wasabi paste, and you'll get little bowls that you can make dipping sauce in. There's also chopsticks on the table. Also, I forgot to mention. If sushi isn't your thing, there's plenty of different options like chicken and rice, and even hamburgers and fries!\\n\\nBut the main focuses in reviews are the food right? I had Spicy Tuna Rolls, California Rolls, Gyoza (similar to potstickers) and for dessert, apple rolls. (I didn't eat this all on my own, don't worry ) Everything was delicious and flavorful. I was mainly impressed with the gyoza and the apple rolls were something I was interested in, because I had never heard of them, but they're basically mini rolled up apple pies. So. Good. The gyoza was hot and with the sauce they were really good too. I had to stop myself from eating all them. \\n\\n\\nOverall, I love this place and impressed with the service and food.

They clearly say that you cannot wear a tank top or bathing suit; this rule appears to only apply to men as half of the women were in tank tops without issue. In fact, you're fine in a midriff shirt with a beer belly poking out so long as your female. Perhaps I wouldn't take offense at the blatant unspoken gender bias, but the place is poorly air conditioned and it was 90 degrees out. So you get to the hostess after a change of wardrobe and are asked where you want to sit. As you systematically select one area after another, you eventually find out that there really is only one place to sit. You feel that you're at Dick's Last Resort and they're intentionally giving you a hard time. Order drinks, and wait. Yes, the thirst is real. Keep waiting. If you get a drink, the second drink will take twicd as long to arrive and I hope you enjoyed it. Needless to say, it's an experience. Portions are sufficient and the food predictably mediocre.

But I walked up to the cart and was greeted by Scott, a very friendly, young, bearded, cowboy hat yielding man who was more than happy to tell me about his business and answer any questions I had. I asked him for recommendations. He named a few. Then he got to the good stuff. \\n\\nHe got to the quarter pound Nathan frank, double wrapped in thick cut bacon, deep fried. That sounded amazing. I looked below it and I saw the brisket dog. What is it? It's a Vienna dog smothered in brisket and barbecue sauce. So all this goodness got the ole mind wheel's turning and I had a revelation on par with Spinoza, or Steve Jobs, or Oprah: combine the two. He was happy and excited to oblige. \\n\\nSo let's get the record straight, because he mentioned adding this to the menu and while Scott is great and will call it whatever he likes, I will forever call it the Romedawg Gonzalez: it's a quarter pound Nathan frank double wrapped in thick cut bacon--deep fried, smothered in a brisket and barbecue goodness, topped with jalapenos on a toasty, buttery bun. I'm not even going to talk about how it tasted because it tasted just as obscenely and illegally delicious as it sounds. I told my friend several times \\"There is nothing wrong with any of this.

I ordered well enough in advance that I was able to send them a check for payment.

The pies were picked up on Wednesday, and stored overnight in the \\"mud-room\\" - which provided the perfect temperature in keeping the crust of both pies crisp and sweet. The pies not only looked GREAT, but they tasted fantastic. The sweet and sugary checkerboard crust on the Cherry, and the light and flakey crust on the Apple provided sneaky guest with plenty of finger picking, lip licking opportunities before the pies were served. The Cherries were sweet, plump and ripe - the Apples were the perfect combination of sweet, tart and firm - with loads of Apple and a hint of buttery taste.

I got the ribs, deep fried wings, and sliced brisket. The ribs were honestly the best ribs I have ever had in my life. I wish I had gotten a full rack.

We found the red option not at all spicy, but the yellow had a bit of a slow burn.  I tamed each with a spreading of the sweet butter.\\n\\nI eyed a neighboring table's 1st course while awaiting our own - their plates held a thin layer of granola topped with a dollop of yogurt and several chunks of colorful fruit... hmmm... perhaps next time?\\n\\nI went with the Caramelized Plantain Empanada, which arrived posed upright on a scoop of cinnamon cream cheese, nice and crisp shelled with lightly sweet brown-orange filling.  Yum!  I also used some of the cream cheese to spread on the cornbread.\\n\\nThe Santa Fe Style Eggs Benedict atop Southwestern Biscuits comes with a jalapeno or habenero (I don't remember which) hollandaise, so as a spice wimp, I requested it served on the side.  It didn't end up tasting spicy to me, so I dolloped it on my eggs at will.  The breakfast potatoes were browned and crisp.  I very much enjoyed my breakfast, including how generously filled the plate looked, except for the fact that while one poached egg was runny as poached eggs are, the other had a hard round yellow yolk surrounded by similarly overcooked egg white.  I'm surprised it had even made it out of the kitchen!  Someone missed this in quality control.\\n\\nWhen I brought it to my server's attention, he brought another egg out shortly, prepared properly.  Sure it would have been nice if the kitchen had served the replacement egg on top of a fresh biscuit since the one I still had was a bit soggy by then, but I still appreciated it.\\n\\nThe bathroom here is nice and roomy, and I eyed the self standing toilet paper roll holder as a great option for nearby Estragon's bathrooms.

Caveat: I am not too familiar with Greek food so I am purely rating this place on how it tasted, without being able to compare it to food from actual Greece.\\n\\nWink and Nod is a basement level, chill, (not too) dimly lit bar that hosts a rotating kitchen of chefs trying out new cuisines. I liked that there were a variety of seating options, from bar to high tables to couches. I don't drink alcohol, but this is the kind of place I order mocktails at because it seems like the mixologists know what they're doing and like being creative. And I was so pleasantly rewarded! The bar brought out a delicious ruby red drink they called a raspberry lemonade, with a skewer of strawberry and blackberry sprinkled with a tiny bit of powdered sugar. So pretty, so tart! A+ for the bar!\\n\\nFor the dinner, I gorged myself on 5 dishes:\\n1. 4 Oysters, perfectly light lemony mignonette\\n2. Wild boar keftedes (wild boar meatballs), gently toasted on the outside and so springy tender on the inside. The yogurt and chili honey on the bottom of the plate paired really well!\\n3. One hundred layer spanakopita (basically spinach pie), really great crispy layer on top and fascinating spongey inside. The layering of spinach and leek and feta created very fun textures to explore while enjoying the well-balanced flavors. This was probably the most traditional Greek thing on the menu.\\n4. Squid, with squid ink aioli and chickpeas. Probably my favorite of the evening. This dish made me remember/realize how terrible most people are at cooking cephalopods. Like, if you're going to kill an intelligent wild animal, at least don't overcook it into a rubbery salty mess. The squid at Pelekasis did the animal justice, though. The texture was pliable and bouncy and the seasonings just enough to bring out the best flavors of squid without overpowering it with salt or oils. The chickpeas were surprisingly good. Soft but not mushy, and had seasonings that were distinct and complementary. I liked the aioli for the irony factor of eating an animal's defense mechanism along with itself.\\n5. Rooster Giouvetsi, adorable small square pasta called hilopites with tender shredded chicken in a tomato sauce. This is a dish that could easily have been way too dense/heavy but even coming on the heels of 4 other dishes, my stomach found room for its surprising lightness. The dish is sweeter and tangier than I expected from looking at it but it grew on me. I could eat it all day.\\n\\nOur server was really friendly and attentive.

Here are my thoughts:\\n\\nThe waitstaff were great. They were attentive and available to answer any questions. I appreciate that very much. Next, the menu. It was too big for my tastes. It took me a good 10 minutes just to get through it all. I should say, it isn't that the menu offers too many dishes, but so many options. I prefer a bit less choice when I am ordering. Again, personal taste, I don't suppose I should fault the establishment. \\n\\nI opted for the pork cheese steak. It is a nice concept, pork instead of beef. The flavors were there. I enjoyed the addition of the \\"dirt\\" spice blend on top. Perhaps the pork could have stayed on the griddle a few seconds less....but hey, a little overcooked pork isn't a big deal. \\n\\nTo accompany the sandwich I had a side of mac and cheese. It was an interesting treatment, topped with crumbled up Cheez-Its. The cheese crackers on top were a nice touch, but I thought the mac and cheese stood fine by itself. \\n\\nEither way, the portions of both sandwich and mac were large enough that I took a box home with me. The to-go boxes are made of compostable material, NOT polystyrene. This is a big plus and I appreciate their efforts to keep the environment free of nasty things.\\n\\nAll in all, it wasn't a bad experience. I will visit again, if only to try one of their frankfurter sandwiches. The pricing scheme is a bit rich for my blood. It would be nice to see sandwiches offered with a side item, instead of being forced to order a la carte.

There are a lot of mediocre or negative reviews of this place that are pretty silly. It's a CORN DOG restaurant. If you don't like corn dogs, or you prefer a Kale and Basil salad with the dressing on the side so you can dip your fork in it and throw 3/4 of it away uneaten than, shocking, you are probably not going to like this place. \\n\\nI lived about 2 blocks from Pallokaville for 5 years. Thank the lord this place didn't open until after I moved or I for sure would have eaten myself to death. I am from MN originally and this place is like the MN state fare only its open year round. After hearing about it/looking at yelp I drove about 45 minutes to try it and was not dissapointed, although my cardiologist is probably now very dissapointed with me.\\n\\nInside/the wait- we got there at 3pm on a Sunday and were immediately seated as a party of 10. It looks like in this regard we were very lucky though- takeaway is probably that you want to go at off peak times if you don't want to wait. \\n\\nShakes- I offered to splut a peanut butter pie shake with someone (the pie shakes come 2 shakes for 12 dollars) and then after making that deal saw the PBJ shake. Devestated. So I tried to weasel out of the deal but the other person was having none of it :(. BUT then fate intervened- as we ordered we were informed there was no available peanut butter pie so PBJ it was and oh my was it good. On a scale of 1- Krispy Kreme at flip burger it was a solid 9.5. It was a little thin for my tastes but other than that perfect.\\n\\nThe sides- I got garbaged tots and mac and cheese so I could try both. The mac and cheese was decent (with cheese it crust) but not life changing. The garbaged tots on the other hand were amazing. \\n\\nThe pork burger- this had been hyped quite a big. To be upfront, I ordered a lot of food, so on the pork burger I did not get bacon or fried egg- obviously a huge mistake. With that in mind, I thought the pork burger was pretty meh at best. It had more vegetation on it than meat and the bun basically collapsed two bites into it. I pawned off most of it on someone else.\\n\\nThe dogs- here is what this place is about. I ordered two corn dogs planning to try both and then eat the better one. I got the regular beef frank with double dipped corn bread batter and then the all 3 sausage one with cheddar batter. They brought out the double dipped first and in my first 2 bites I didn't even make it to the hot dog there was so much batter- THIS IS NOT A BAD THING. It was a delicious thing - like an 8th grade girl on instagram I have no regrets. I got about 1/2 way into it whenthey brought the other dog. Now, intheory this seemed genius- you get to try all 3 meats in one. In practice I did not like it as much because the 3 sausages are seperately cased and this makes it impossible to slide them up the stick so you have to bite into the side of the corn dog which is super annoying and makes proper sauce dipping impossible. The cheddar batter was good but can't compete with double corn bread (what can? I contend nothing).\\n\\nDessert was not on the menu at the ER I was rushed to after eating. \\n\\nThey also have a bunch of fancy pants soda but as soda is inferior to a milkshake and I only had on regular pants I did not get to try them.

The crawfish, which we bought fresh by the pound and had steamed to order, were delicious. A little small in size for being bought in April but still great. The hush puppies are made with more cornmeal (more authentic) than the flour-based ones most places serve here in Georgia.  The crawfish poboy was absolutely divine. They brushed the *real* French bread with a little bit of butter, a tad untraditional but it added moisture to a normally dry sandwich. The roumalade was also untraditional, consisting of more red sauce than creamy light pink mayo, but the flavor was SPOT ON. And probably healthier too!

The meat on the ribs was so tender it literally slid off the bone. I teared up during the meal because it was so good. Fatt Matt's is the real deal. Definitely recommend, and come hungry!\\n\\n--\\n\\nI wanted to get ribs somewhere local, and was adamant about not going to a chain restaurant. My parents suggested Fat Matt's (which is popular among the locals).\\n\\nThe employees were really helpful in suggesting what to try since it was our first time there. Love the vibe of the place. We arrived a little early for dinner, and missed the live music, which usually begins after 6:30PM. \\n\\nThe quality and amount of food you get is definitely worth the price. My mom and I shared a 1/2 slab of ribs with sides of collared greens, mac & cheese, and beans (which were cooked to perfection, if I must say so myself). I got a beer. Mom had lemonade (free refills). My dad got an order of the chicken and coleslaw (that was some darn good coleslaw, people. KFC ain't got nothing on that stuff). I think the total ended up being around $34. I mean, c'mon that's a great price for that much food. We also had a slice of the sweet potato pie, which was a great way to finish it all off.

It is normally a good place for people watching. Not on this day. It could have been the heat. They had the windows closed. That was a disappointment. The drinks were fantastic. I had the mojito and a friend had the white grape martini. We tried to mimic the recipe later but it just wasn't the same. The food is decent but that's not why I go here. I always enjoy the pizza but wasn't very hungry so I ordered the spring rolls. They were kind of bland. I wanted to try the cuban sandwich but just did not have the appetite. I'll have to make sure I am more hungry the next time I have out of town guests."},{"name":"Mettle - East Austin Bistro","address":"507 Calles St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Went to Mettle on a Sunday afternoon for brunch after walking by previously when doing a beer tasting next door at Hops and Grain Brewery.  The interior is absolutely stunning- think industrial with a cool vibe.  I am certain that at night the place would be incredibly sexy.... perfect for a date.  The hostess was extremely pleasant and helpful getting our group settled in.  The food was outstanding.  I had the avocado stuffed with crab meat topped with pork belly crumbles.....  I could have licked my plate if I was at home.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken friend beef cheeks which were so moist they fell apart with your fork.  The portion of beef cheeks was rather large so it would be good to have as a plate to share between two.  Cocktails were spot on, the siamese caipirinha was very good- I loved the hot peppers floating on a leaf of basil!  The only draw back to the experience was the noise level when we first entered...... Going with 6 people it was rather hard to hear everyone- not deafening, just a little too loud......luckily for us the place cleared out a bit as we were at the end of the brunch service."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Fusion food menu is unique and taste delicious. Tried the bacon tuna sandwhich from the burshi menu. Service was a little slow and the wait was over 30 minutes because of park hours closing. Other than that would like to come back and try other things on the menu."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Portland.. one of my favorite cities in USA. Perhaps it's because it is the first US city I have visited henceforth it's my first love. Screen Door, however, isn't the first place I had chicken & waffle. But it's probably the chicken & waffle place in north-West. \\n\\nThis review is post the numerous times I have been to SD. I had a short biz trip and just have to eat that C&W despite a 40 mins drive. Came in on a Thursday night, and yes, there's a long line at 7pm. Parking is tight with only street parking but within 3 blocks, you should find a spot. The wait was about 20 mins and same time for food after putting in our orders. \\n\\nHad a side of fried oysters - fresh, juicy and plump w the right crunch & side dip. Catfish was alright, it's juicy too but I had better ones in Boiling Crab, San Jose. Ordered the fried chicken entree (no waffles on weekday nights *sad face) and it was a huge portion as usual - fried chicken was fabulous, collard greens was cooked right and flavorful, and mashed potatoes was awesome (I don't usually say that). \\n\\nTip: The side of fried chicken tenders is not the same as the fried chicken entree. The cut is different so the entree chicken is a lot more juicy and tasty."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love the food.

I was pleasantly surprised. Very cool atmosphere, a little noisy but fun, active, happy people Fiday after work kind of noise, nice to be surrounded by.  The rustic decor suits the food very well. I had Bandera Chicken, a mesquite barbeque breast with a nice lime (I think) glazing. I adored the broiled avacado with mango side. A plate full of thi=ose would do nicely. They serve this dish with shoe string fries, delicious, a departure from the expected rice and beans.  The waiter was adorable, attentive and worth the big tip. The meal was so reasonable even with a drink, we were surprised.  Half the price of the less substantial meal meal, also with one drink, in the hotel bar the night before. Yes, we will go back."},{"name":"Hey Cupcake!","address":"5530 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"3xRed Velvets. 1x24 Carrot.\\n\\nThis was a delicious treat for a few good friends.

Mind you the place opens at 11. At around ten or so a gentleman came out and told us that someone would be coming by to take an order so that they can estimate how much people are going to buy. They also came around a few times selling beer and sodas for $3 to drink while you wait if you didn't already bring some libations to consume. At 11 the line started moving slowly they came by and told us to be prepared to be there until at least 2:30 we didn't believe it at first but as the hours started to pass it became a more realistic time frame. So be prepared to wait. Bring chairs, a blanket to sit on, snacks, sunscreen etc. plan to make a day of it. Okay now for the good stuff we made it inside at around 3 pm just inside the wall had benches to sit on and they come by and offer you more drinks while you wait. When we got to the counter we put in our order. I got the tipsy Texan which is their brisket sandwich topped with sausage and cole slaw. I believe it was $8 I also ordered some pork ribs which were amazing. Meat just fell right off of the bone. They have 3 different BBQ sauces available at the table for you to add to your meat. They also offer pies by cake and spoon. We had the banana bourbon which was quite yummy. \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience we met some really nice people in line, the employees were soo friendly it and the food was amazing. At first I was like this is a one time thing but I'm hooked. I would definitely do it again in a heartbeat if it meant having some more of their delicious food."},{"name":"The Hideaway Bar","address":"516 Virginia Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Best little bar in all of Orlando.
