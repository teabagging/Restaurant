My experience at this location was all but spectacular. We came on a Sunday morning, which I expected breakfast places to be busy, so I did not mind waiting. We called ahead and the lady said it was only a 20 minute wait. We drove over, and the place was packed. No open table or open places at the bar. Again, Sunday morning so I wasn't too surprised, and I also knew how popular they are. The hostess said it would only be 25 minutes. I trusted her, even with the crazy amount of people huddled around. (There is no \\"waiting area\\"). I was given a buzzer and found a place to stand. A lot of waiting customers were standing basically in the kitchen behind the bar. This was a little disturbing to me, sanitary wise. I could tell the employees were frantic from how busy it was, and they were not rude but not very kind either. I was in a party of 2, but several times people who had walked in after us were seated before us. Even a large party of 10 that came in after us were seated immediately, which I did not understand. (I know they do not take reservations). Maybe they were a call ahead, but it still upset me, as my fianc√© and I waited 50 minutes to be seated! I trusted the hostess from the beginning with her saying it would not be more than 25 minutes. That was far from the truth. We could have gone to any of the first few places we had called that morning. After asking 3 different times what place we were at on the list (since it was taking a century), we were finally seated. Our server was incredibly bubbly and attentive, which brightened my mood immediately. The food was alright. Nothing special or life changing. I got an omelette with potatoes. The omelette had way too much meat for my liking. The potatoes were a let down for sure. Coffee was good though! I tried the grits and they were yummy.

No denying it.\\n\\nNo matter what time of day I've ended up at the Flying Biscuit, I always end up ordering breakfast - usually an omelette.  I've had the Hollywood (great tomato coulis topping), the scrambled tofu (don't knock it til you've tried it - it's actually fantastic tasting) and most recently I really threw caution to the wind and tried the Piedmont omelette.  Living life on the wild side, I know.  \\n\\nAnd don't even get me started on their biscuits - those things are so addictive, and add a little of that signature apple butter and they're like crack cocaine.  I can't get enough of it.

We also ended up with a free loaf of bread, which they explained was made from the leftover pizza dough from the day before (bonus!). The Gypsy came out really quick (~10 minutes) and just wOW. From the crust to the cheese to the toppings, everything was perfect and scrumptious. \\n\\nThe nutella bites and the Dante's kiss didn't impress me as much as the Gypsy though. The nutella bites didn't have too much nutella, and I feel like you could pass those for $5. The Dante's kiss lacked the substantial toppings of the Gypsy - I wish it had more cheese / just stuff in general on top.\\n\\nOne suggestion: I like the rustic feel of the wooden tables, but the one I sat at had an uneven surface which caused us to spill our cups of water - maybe sand the table or fill it in so it's flat?

We did not, so the hostess needed to check her book, but not before discussing another issue with a server before deciding that she had a table for us on the outdoor patio.  After being seated, at a table that did not have any place settings, we waited for about 10 minutes before anyone came to offer water, then a few more minutes before being asked if we wanted cocktails.  By the way, they do not have a cocktail menu, odd in this day and age of cocktail revival in Portland, but, sorry, we're in Lake Oswego, not cocktail menu here!  \\nWe receive cocktails, but during the wait for the cocktails, we decide it might be best to order our meal the minute the cocktails arrive  since we feel we may be waiting quite a while to see our server after the cocktails arrive.    Appetizers were decent, a seared ahi tuna on a bed of mixed greens is fairly decent, simple in its preparation, but seared rare with a sesame seed crust and fresh with a pomegranate vinaigrette and wasabi cream sauce, with a few slices of apple.  The smoked trout dip was fine, slightly spicy, but the house-made potato chips were crisp, not greasy, and thick.  The star on the table, however, was a roasted red pepper and garlic olive oil that was provided with the focaccia bread.\\nEntrees were disappointing; Diver scallops with a rice pilaf were baffling.  The rice pilaf had orzo, frozen peas & carrots in brightly colored turmeric rice with cheese, absolutely no flavor.  But really, who puts cheese in rice pilaf?  The diver scallops were seared & cooked properly, but the caper-butter sauce was, as the rice pilaf, completely flavorless and slightly gelatinous.  The seared halibut was over cooked and dry, the fingerling potatoes were rubbery; the mango salsa was tasty as was the peeled baby carrots.  The lobster ravioli was smothered in a sundried tomato cream sauce with a few prawns & crab on top.  It did have some flavor, but the lobster ravioli was totally obscured by too much of the cream sauce.\\nI find that while my expectations were met, I am still disappointed.  We paid too much for the food put before us and by the service provided.  In such a place as Lake Oswego, one should not rest on the fact that they operate such a lovely restaurant on a private lake and if they build it, people will come. One should be inspired by such a view, and challenge themselves to  provide the service and food that people will enjoy.  Will I return?

Two enthusiastic barbecue sauced thumbs up!"},{"name":"Maritime Cafe","address":"17415 SE McLoughlin Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Much more here than meets the eye, here!\\n\\nI firmly believe in loyalty. I have been \\"married\\" to the same Portland dispensary for a few years. Their loyalty to me has been hit and miss, at best. I use a particular RSO for pain. After spending over 30 years in the MMA--I have pain. Lots of pain, always. The RSO I use has significantly reduced my pain and swelling. My go-to dispensary apparently has had a very difficult time keeping this RSO in supply. It works wonderfully for others, as well. \\n\\nOne day out of frustration over going weeks without pain relief and hearing my normal dispensary tell me, \\"...we are expecting it any time. Keep calling in to see if we have it.\\" I decided to get more proactive in my pursuit of this particular RSO. I started calling every dispensary in my local vicinity. I even called the manufacturer of this RSO in Brookings, OR. They weren't much help. \\n\\nMy fortune changed when I called Maritime Cafe and spoke with Celina! She was unbelievably nice and incredibly knowledgeable about everything in their store. \\"We have your RSO! I will have one of our budtenders set it aside for you, to make things easier when you get here.\\", she said. I was THRILLED! I made the short trip to their location to acquire my much-needed pain relief. \\n\\nThis location is an unassuming storefront in a strip center. I wondered if they were really going to be able to take care of my needs. BOY WAS I SURPRISED!!! \\n\\nThis place is amazing! Their staff is razor sharp when it comes to their knowledge of medical needs. Celina, true to her word, had reserved my RSO in the back. I met her, she was delightful--as well as very professional and welcoming, super fresh face meeting with new clients... Once the ID process was concluded, she granted me passage into the back where the products are housed. This unassuming storefront seemed to be hiding an amazing experience within! Everything is clean, well stocked, well displayed, and the staff is wonderfully helpful without being overbearing. Even their bathroom is spotless! \\n\\nA manager sold me my RSO. It was a little different than what I had been using. She advised I give it a try and let them know if it worked for me or not. I did... and it did. In fact... It was way better than what I had been using! I was so happy I called into them after returning home and giving it some time to work. I talked to the wonderfully delightful Celina again. I expressed my complete satisfaction with my shopping experience and love for this new RSO product. She assured me they would go ahead and order more to take care of my pain management. I had heard this from my former supplier many times, only to be disappointed.  \\n\\nA week later, I received a call from (guess who?) Celina! They had received a fresh supply of my RSO. I immediately returned to purchase another tube of this medicine as well as a backup tube for my peace of mind. \\n\\nI can't tell you how many times my former dispensary was so empty while I was there. In some cases, I was able to just stand around and chit-chat for a while with the staff. NOT THE CASE HERE!!! They are rockin' it full time! Every time I have been there, they have had plenty of clients taking advantage of their superior business model. That tells me they are keeping people happy. It is hard enough to earn money--it shouldn't be difficult or frustrating to spend it. It is clear to me that they understand this concept at Maritime Cafe.  \\n\\nThis place is super busy. Not so much that they can't handle it either. You get in, find what you need (or want) without being rushed, their staff is super effective in executing a streamlined service and purchase process. They are professionally friendly, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful. They listen and back up their promises. Consistency is key with my needs. \\n\\nIn my experience? This is the best dispensary I have ever visited! So much so, I divorced my former location. Now I am happily \\"married\\" to Maritime Cafe! I look forward to my next visit and every visit after that."},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"The best Thai food I have eaten.

We asked one of the waiters to bring us some utensils. Our waitress brings it out. But, she didn't bring out plates.... So we waved another waiter down to bring out the plates. They finally brought it out so we could eat our food. All of our food came out except for two appetizers that we ordered. Turns out, she never put them in. I was really upset, cause those two were the main things I ordered out of the group! The manager, David Song, came out and apologized. I would come back as long as she was not our server. \\nFood wise: \\nGarlic edamame: Has a smokey garlic taste to it. It's addicting!\\nUni (California): The uni was amazing that night. It tasted so fresh. On top of that, they gave me a little extra. I was very happy with the uni,\\nAnkimo: (monk fish liver) tasted very good. I usually like ponzu with my ankimo. They gave me a cilantro-gochujang ponzu which they use for the escolar appetizer. It was pretty good, but I prefer regular ponzu with my ankimo.\\nChilli Escolar: has super white tuna, honey thai chili, garlic chip vinaigrette in a cilantro-gochujang ponzu. This is one of my favorites. It's buttery with a citrus taste to it. Plus, it's really cheap. Especially on the HH menu. \\nfoxy lady roll: tuna, escolar, cooked shrimp topped with salmon, avocado, wasabi tobiko and\\n side of cilantro ponzu sauce. This was pretty good.

The lighting is perfect; we all looked at least 5 years younger (or was that the wine?), the colors and decor warm and inviting and, my favorite part, it is quiet thanks to the lovely upholstery, draperies and carpet that is laid throughout.

At first, when we arrived and were ushed down a dark, very narrow basement corridor, I thought, hmm, this is a \\"fancy shmancy French restaurant\\"?  (Note if you are over 5'10\\" watch your head, tons of places to smash it, its so low!) So we arrive on the basement level, very small, dark and I guess \\"romantic\\".  We were led up to the first floor via a narrow staircase.  We sit down to a 1700 style interior with a fire place.  The server stated they are only one of the few places in Boston to be grandfathered into a law that doesn't allow real fireplaces in restaurants, so they boast this.  But it was July, so who cares about a fireplace.\\n\\nWe sit down, and one girl notices her wine glass is dirty, still has lipstick from previous patron.  Eww!  Now thinking about the dark basement where the kitchen is and all the cooking, I doubt they have a dishwasher and probably wash carelessly by hand?  So I checkout my glass, eww, its dirty too.  The server seems offended that the dirty glasswhere was pointed out, he brings out a replacement, but with a little attitude.  Dude, you are a server here, not the owner, I get taking pride in your restaurant, but then you should have inspected the items BEFORE people arrive.\\n\\nThe server just irked me the wrong way.  He was old school, talked elegantly to the men (took men's orders first, ahead of ladies), and treated women a little like second grade citizens.  Perhaps that happened in 1700 like the bldg., but that crap doesn't fly!  He said he was French and did his whole French accent.  Until one of our guests started speaking French to him, he opened his eyes, \\"oh you are French?\\"  The guy said yes, born & raised, just came to US 2 yrs ago.  He asked the server what part of France he's from, to which he replied \\"oh, I'm German\\", so why are you lying and introducing yourself as French, ugh.  \\n\\nThe food is mediocre.  I was thinking since the server was making this place out to be like Boston's top fancy restaurant it would be exquisite, it was not.  I had fried breaded eggplant as an appetizer it was pretty good.  My colleague had some salad, that were 4 wedges of romaine lettuce sprinkled with thousand island.. he said McDonald's salad tasted better.  For the main course I had veal in a lobster sauce that was the special of the day.  Again just ok, nothing that I'd come back for.  The portions are on the small side.\\n\\nHere's the horrible part.  Its end of July, its a hot & muggy evening, this place has no AC.  Yes, no AC.  This is not fancy or shmancy, this is downright a sweatshop.  I think I lost 3 lbs of water sweating in there.  We asked if he could crack a window, as the 20 of us in a small room with hot food had probably raised the temp another 10 degrees.  He said fire code does not allow it, cause kids could fall out the window, so he brought a fan, set it on low, and left.  We swealtered in there!  When he came to ask about dessert for the 2nd or 3rd time, we said give us the check, we are out of here, we cant take it.  He went on and on about outside seating in some back gazebo, how we can request it for our next corporate outing.  Hey hotshot, we complained about it being a swealtering mess up here, and you couldn't move us to the empty gazebo, and you think we and our $ are coming back?

Unfortunately, tonight was the night we brought some friends from out of town here and were hoping to take them to a sushi place that wasn't exorbitant but good. They weren't super impressed, and I found myself apologizing - never a good scene. \\n\\nThe agedashi tofu is always a winner, there are lots of options for people who don't like raw fish (or fish in general), and they're great about reservations. \\n\\nI'd avoid the seafood gyoza and any rolls with goat cheese/feta on them - to me, the taste of something naturally pungent on fresh fish is overpowering. \\n\\nI'm sure I'll be back to Hanabi some day - but after the experience we had tonight, it might be a while."},{"name":"Tom, Dick & Hank","address":"191 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"TDH has a really cool after-work atmosphere on Tuesday's. A group of cigar enthusiasts take over the rooftop and the DJ is great. The food and service is another story. On my first visit to TDH, I ordered the dry rub wings and turkey ribs which were really good but the side of macaroni and cheese had a long black hair in it. Of course I was grossed out and had to send it back but the manager on duty was pleasant and took it off my bill. This week I went back and our server was all over the place. She was forgetting orders, giving us the wrong orders, didn't know what was on the menu, messing up checks...just a hot mess. Other servers were dropping plates. This time I ordered the fish sandwich which came with tomato and pickle. The flavor was good but the tomato made the bread completely soggy which wasn't pleasant to eat. I also ordered the banana pudding cheesecake and after 35 minutes, I asked the waitress if it would be coming out soon and she nonchalantly told me they didn't have any...after all that time. My friends had already sent their orders of macaroni and cheese back twice because the cheese had an odd taste.

Which is not the usual case for freshly prepared Indian food. And when I asked the waiter he told us it was made fresh and from the scratch!!? I told him that nan is cold, biryani chicken pieces are really hard and very dark, and that tandoori is really dry and the bones were burned!! and it was obvious that they reheat the whole order from previously made food. Yet, he told me that he DOES NOT CARE WHAT I THINK OR WHAT I SAY. I was really shocked that he said that but it is almost usual that you will find bad service with the poorly prepared food.

They've moved all their Sushi to a different location. This location now specializes in Ramen and Bento boxes. Therefore, any reviews written before June 15th, 2016, no longer applies.\\n\\nLet's just say that their menu needs some major work... and they know it.\\n\\nWe tried the Miso Ramen and the Bulgogi Ramen and they were mediocre at best. The miso ramen was the better one. The broth was pretty standard and the chashu had a grilled/smoked flavor to it. Pretty average, maybe just slightly better than something I can cook myself at home with package ramen. Now for the bulgogi ramen, the flavors just didn't work together. Ramen is a traditionally savory dish and the sweetness of the bulgogi was going against it. I mean the cook of the bulgogi by itself was great, tender and flavorful, but it just didn't work in the ramen. We also tried their Karage appetizer and it was once again, just average and lacked seasoning.\\n\\nThey've really got their works cut out for them if they want to compete in the ramen ring. If I wanted ramen, I would easily pick Tatsu-ya, Jinya, or even Michi over Hanabi, and it's not even close. $12 is quite expensive for a bowl of ramen in Austin, but they do back it up with a decent portion size. Also, they're clearly still fine-tuning their flavors as the waitress literally came out at the end asking us to critique the dish. Not just \\"how was your meal?\\" More like \\"are you 100% satisfied with the flavors?\\", \\"how can we change it?\\", etc.\\n\\nLastly, they really needs to get the word out there that they've reopened. We came just over a week after they reopened, on a Friday night at 9pm, and the place was dead. There was only one other table and soon we were the only ones there. This should be more of a 2-star review but since they're still in their startup phase with their new menus, I'll cut them some slacks."},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"10000 Research Blvd, Ste 142","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Burgers are ok, pretty much tastes like theme park food.

My girlfriend doesn't share my arbitrary prejudice, fortunately, so we ended up ordering some take out from them tonight.  I was pleasantly surprised.  \\n\\nI picked up our take out order, and as soon as I set foot in the door I immediately liked the place.

They were well dressed, and I could tell they were trying to give a good first impression.  The two I talked to (and the one I spoke to on the phone) spoke English very well.\\n\\nThe General Gao's bean curd was surprisingly good.  It was lightly fried, and the sauce was served on the side.  The girlfriend likes brown rice, and they had a brown rice option here (which we hardly ever see anywhere).  The veggie lo mein was better than most, but the missus wasn't crazy about the broccoli in garlic sauce, although I thought it was pretty good.   My fortune cookie told me I was a kind and understanding person, and the girlfriend's cookie told her she had a sympathetic heart, so I guess these were more like compliment cookies.

Got a couple of happy hour house margaritas and could only taste the mix. Evidently they save money by excluding tequila at happy hour. \\n\\nBeing as this was happy hour, the appetizers were half price so my wife got a chicken quesadilla and I ordered the Agave Sampler which had a variety of different appetizer options. \\n\\nWaiter came over after in a few minutes and told me the sampler was not half price so I needed to pick something else. I decided, instead, to get the \\"trio\\" sampler instead which was ceviche, queso dip, salsa, and chips. \\n\\nWe ordered another drink. Decided to try the coin style marg after that so we'd get less of the mix this time. Drinks came so limey they were undrinkable. I sent them back and got basically a short glass of what we got with the original house marg--all mix still but at least not so limey. Bartender obviously had no clue how to make drinks and didn't seem to care. \\n\\nFood finally showed up about a half hour later cold. They also forgot the ceviche, but that eventually arrived when we asked about it. The queso dip showed up as a solid, gelatinous brick...basically inedible as a dip. Ceviche was OK, but nothing special. \\n\\nThe salsa was not much hotter than ketchup and a similar consistency. It was also served in a vessel not much bigger than a shot glass. There were 3 lukewarm tortillas and some generic corn chips on the plate. Wife's quesadilla was cold and underseasoned. \\n\\nWe complained to the waiter about the food when he finally came back to the table 10 minutes later and he apologized, but didn't offer to do anything other than get me something else. I think at minimum he could have offered to reheat the queso dip, but by this time I was not convinced it would be worth the effort. He said he'd bring a box for the leftover quesadilla, but that never arrived.\\n\\nWe finally got the bill and we were charged for everything so we asked the waiter to see the manager to discuss the food and the possibility of a discount because of the poor quality. The waiter came back 5 minutes later saying the manager had stepped out and we could sit around and wait for him if we wanted, but he could not comp anything on the bill and nobody else in the restaurant could either. \\n\\nAt this point, we just wanted to get out of there so I paid the bill and left no tip--something I probably haven't done in 30 years. \\n\\nBottom line...we will not return.

He said that if you haven't had them before they are a must try. When the fries arrived, I was surprised by the size of the dish (it was large) and its presentation with a soft egg (chicken or duck? we were not informed) on top. That said, we just paid $8 for a bowl of french fries. The fries at P. Terry's are better. I was shocked the server pushed these as hard as he did because if it wasn't for that fact I would have given this restaurant 3 or maybe 4 stars. If I ordered a burger then this might be an appropriate side dish, but it is not an appropriate appetizer.\\n\\nI ordered the candied pork belly for my main dish. It was served on a bed of collared greens. The greens had a great flavor, but the pork belly was served to me at room temperature and didn't have much flavor which is also surprising for such a fatty cut of meat.  \\n\\nWe ordered brussel sprouts to share.

I tend to be a buffet hater. My mother, however, would love to eat at buffets for every meal every day of her life.  Wild Rice is her favorite Asian buffet. Me?  It's not the worst place I've ever been. \\n\\nWild Rice is in a building that has been many different businesses, from an after hours rave club to a western country bar. I was shocked to see that it had transformed into a restaurant. There's something a little weird knowing that you're eating sushi in an establishment that was once filled with sweaty, underage drinkers and candy ravers blowing up on ecstasy. The outside is run down, but it's surprisingly clean inside.\\n\\nThe selection of foods is basic Asian buffet fare: stir fried veggies and meats, fried rice, heavy sauces. The hibachi grill is a nice touch. It's comforting to watch your food being cooked at a buffet. They have a larger variety of seafood than what you may typically see at a smaller buffet. The sushi selection is varied and really not that bad. \\n\\nSince I only go to buffets when I have to (mom's birthday and Mother's Day) and I really don't like buffets in general, I typically rate experiences on how sick I get when I leave. I am happy to say that I have eaten a wild rice about a half dozen times and I have never gotten sick!

Yes both the interior and exterior are dated. From the outside it doesn't look like much. But, places like this are becoming a rarity especially in the Metro Atlanta area. The food is good and plentiful for the price. The chips are served hot. The salsa is good and the margaritas are even better. But there's a special vibe inside of this restaurant. Geographically the restaurant sits at that place where Norcross turns into Tucker or vise versa I guess, depending on your direction of travel. That means you're just as likely to be dining near a Jackson, a Cofer, or a Diaz. That is a wonderful thing. Sometimes we forget just how well good food can unite us. El Matador reminds us and brings us together with good food and good drink."},{"name":"Anna Bannanas St. Johns","address":"8716 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great late breakfast enjoyed out in some early fall sun!

Things to try: \\"Swimming Rama,\\" seasonal steamed veggies with that famous Thai peanut sauce and brown rice. I think I've ordered it the last three visits. Another great dish, although not available at the moment (menu changes periodically) is the orange chicken. And it's not the sticky sweet Chinese version you're thinking of. Thai Bloom scores a giant chicken breast and deep-fries it to golden perfection and ladles a perfectly balanced orange sauce on top (not smothered). Add some veggies and brown rice and it's comfort food at its best. The only bad experience was when my husband ordered the duck salad and while the flavors were excellent, there was way too much duck fat for his taste. The owner was gracious enough to take a few dollars off our bill though.\\n\\nAttentive and friendly service, clean, and pretty busy most of the time.

Normally, that wouldn't have been a big deal, but he continued to call me that even after I (a) corrected him, and (b) did so in Mandarin. Also, I am literally made in China (born there, got the fob shot for proof), so don't try to tell me what nationality I am. \\n\\nTo be fair, that in itself wouldn't have bothered me enough for me to lower my rating. Rather, I'm doing it because of what transpired during my most recent visit. We had ordered three dishes, and the third dish took *forever* to come out. As in, the first two plates came out, and we were completely finished with those two (and already full) for over 10 minutes by the time the third dish came out. What was the reason, you ask? Is this a complicated dish that takes over half an hour to cook? \\n\\nNO. \\n\\nApparently, the only person who knew how to make this dish was the owner, and he wasn't at the store at the time. So, rather than letting us know that we would have to wait a while if we wanted this dish, they just let us sit there. And wait. And wonder where on earth our food was. \\n\\nThey also acted as if it was the most natural thing in the world to make us wait an extra 20-25 minutes for one of our orders. This is the definition of poor customer service. The dish itself was decent, but nowhere even near worth the wait. It was a tofu soup! Making it probably took less than 10 minutes. I would've rather ordered something else (or not gotten anything at all) than had to wait for so long.\\n\\nFor all you naysayers out there who argue that legit Chinese restaurants aren't known for their service, I contend that they're not known for *attentive* service. They won't be checking in on you to see how you're doing or if you need a refill or water, but they will give you very fast service. All I want is to order my food and have it served in a reasonable amount of time (which has always been the case at other good Chinese restaurants). Anything that takes longer than 30 minutes to come out (especially for a reason as poor as \\"the only person who knows how to make it isn't here yet\\"), I expect to be TOLD of that circumstance.\\n\\nIn honesty, I probably will be back next time I want Chinese food because the food quality has been consistently solid every time, but I'm going to inquire very closely about their ability to bring me my food in an acceptable amount of time. \\n\\nUgh. I hate when service and food quality just don't match up."},{"name":"Nirvana Restaurant","address":"2313 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I was recommended this restaurant by the food writer for the financial times of london as I was desperate for a good curry in Vancouver which was not Vij's; it is good but I do not wnat to line up all the time.\\n\\nFirst of all it is near one of my favourite bookstore in vanlcuver so a good execuse to go out there.\\n\\nFirst off the offer for a starter I usually turn down but I saw pakoras with Corinader which was tempting...

The pork was slightly over cooked (white, thus the 4-stars), however, I was still very happy with how juicy it was.

Changed from Korean Street chicken to something else. I still did not like the meat, I was not expecting for top quality meat but just a regular chicken meat and that's not what I got.

They were quick to refill coffees which is always nice. \\nThe menu wasn't extensive, but covered all the bases. I got the mexican breakfast burrita and he got the huevos rancheros. Both looked great. Mine came with well cooked hashbrowns. My burrito wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked it, but it was good a filling. I always expect so much flavor from chorizo, but I'm learning that some forms can be rather mild. So the vegetables in the monster burrito were cooked perfectly, not too soft, not too mushy, and it had corn, which i am totally into. I did not like either hot sauce they offered on the table. Both tasted funny to me (I can't remeber the brand) But, if you can, bring a bottle of Tapatio from home. That'd be perfect! \\nOver all a good breakfast, but just not a WOW breakfast.

I asked for some hot peppers, but he told me he'd add sriracha to it. I had a choice of lamb or beef and I chose lamb. There was a good mix of lettuce, tomato and onion and of course plenty of feta cheese. It was worth the extra buck to get the larger one.

I'd made a reservation, but the restaurant hadn't filled up yet so we were seated immediately. Ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. The size of the appetizer was average. That's the one gripe I have - their appetizer prices aren't scaled down. Some are the price of an entree! \\n\\nBut then my vegetarian pasta dish came and it was HUGE! Giant fresh ravioli, zucchini, broccoli, and peas drowned in marinara sauce. So delicious! I could barely eat any of the ravioli after nibbling on bread, wine, and the appetizer. My family's entrees were humongous as well. \\n\\nLove that they have a full bar, but went with the delicious Prosecco. Riesling tasted like juice, but I guess you roll the dice with American Riesling. Finally, I ordered the warm apple pie and vanilla gelato.

The food is fine..I just don't like to get short-changed. it's not worth the aggravation to \\"bring it to her attention\\", although I am sure she does it on purpose because it has happened THE LAST 5 TIMES! I realize it's only a dollar, but if the bill for a dinner (with appetizer) is $23.25, and I hand her a $50 or $100, she will tell me she is \\"rounding it off\\". Usually when an owner \\"rounds it off\\" (since it IS over $20 for one dinner), you assume she is rounding it off to $23, not $24!! This constant nickle and diming really upsets me. I used to go about 3 times a month. Now I am down to every Quarter (the last Friday of every 3rd month). Since I work downtown, Rock Sugar is as close to me as Chinatown, which is where I normally go. The last time I was there (last week), I had the $23.25 Dinner. I waited (which I have goten used to...I usually stare at the goldfish). I also usually bring my own Ziplock bag, since I go there at 4:00 PM and have to take a train home. The cook that prepared it said \\"it is ready\\" and I went to the counter and picked up the bag. I took it back to my seat to unstaple it and put the containers in the Ziplock. When I opened it up, I realized that OVER HALF THE CONTAINER WAS RICE! Since I get the dinner portion and order (and pay for) the rice separately, the container has always had jUST SEAFOOD..no rice already mixed in. The girl saw me looking at the container, and came out and told me that was the Lunch portion...not the Dinner portion I paid for. She offered me back the difference in price. I told her to just figure out the difference and make it up by adding an appetizer, which she did. i do not believe that the cook did not know. Before he handed it to me he said \\"$23.25...have you paid yet?\\" I'm sure he knew none of their lunches are $23.25. I don't think I will ever be back. Chinatown is equally close for me. Like I stated earlier...THE FOOD IS FINE...I just hate getting ripped off.

While getting ready to sit down, I put my hand on the table in some yucky, sticky residue, so immediately asked the young man to please wipe the table.\\nWe were excited to see some papaya and dragonfruit, but then, some other things that we had no idea what they were and we chose not to try.  Some items were missing labels as to what they were.\\nThere were big trays of good sized shrimp with shells on and oysters on ice that looked good, but it was cold outside, so we wanted hot food.  Steamed oysters were also available, but were brought out in limited supply, almost as if they were cooked only when new people came in?\\nThere were temperature issues with some of the more common Chinese buffet type foods, such as the General Tso's and Kung Pao: the tables were steaming, but in the very short time it took to return to my seat, the food was almost cold.\\nI generally opt not to eat rice and noodles at Asian food buffets, but prefer vegetables as a bed for the other foods instead: there were no green beans which I usually use for the bed, but instead asparagus was available, but was so limited as to the amount that it was not something I could use for the bed of other meat dishes.  \\nHot and sour soup is another of my faves, but their soup was the worst I have ever had: it wasn't hot (spicy), nor sour and just badly lacking in flavor.\\nAt the far back of the last of the buffet tables, there was a piece of cleaning equipment of some sort, perhaps for cleaning the floors, that was parked there and it was so dirty and dusty that it really grossed me out that it was anywhere near any food: definitely not a place for storage.\\nNear the front entryway is an ice cream chest style freezer with the sliding glass doors and within, of course, was the big cardboard containers of various types of ice cream.  That was fine for usage to provide ice cream for the customers, and it is self-serve: the issue is that the restaurant does not provide serving utensils of any sort, leaving customers to use their eating utensils from their table.  And they do not provide additional clean eating utensils beyond what is initially upon the table when customers are seated.\\nSo the chocolate ice cream looked good, except that the container was 95% empty and in the bottom lay 2 forks that may very well have been another customers utensils!

Unfortunately they were out of the she-crab soup.\\n\\nEntrees were two of the filets (cooked perfectly but could've been warmer when actually served), the mushroom pasta with chicken added (lots of flavor), and the New Zealand lamb chops (these were amazing, just the right amount of marbling, great flavor without any gaminess, and served at a very nice medium finish).\\n\\nDesserts were the bread pudding and chocolate cake. They were both good but the bread pudding was our favorite.\\n\\nThe waiter and the manager were both very helpful.

We were feeling peckish afterwards so decided to come here with Karen's mom after hearing her talk about it a couple of times. It's a typical Hong Kong-style cafe serving specials pretty much all day. For the uninitiated, the specials are typically a rice or noodle of some sort served with a drink. There was no wait when we got there at 2pm but according to her mom, there's typically a long wait at lunch time. Here's what we had:\\n\\n\\"Singapore Style\\" Fried Vermicelli - $9.50 with a Hot Drink - Noodles and toppings were fine but the seasoning really let it down. Probably wouldn't order again - 2/5\\n\\nChicken Chow Mein - $9.50 with a Hot Drink - An average example of a cantonese classic. Mostly good but letdown but the lack of crispy noodles - 3/5\\n\\nLuncheon Meat & Egg Sandwich $6.50 with a Hot Drink - This may seem like an odd choice but it's one of our favorite things to order at a HK style cafe in Hong Kong. The perfect one has super fluffy scrambled eggs with crazy white slightly sweet break. No place in Vancouver has been able to do it to perfection and Happy Day unfortunately doesn't break that trend. Nevertheless, not bad but nothing special - 3/5\\n\\nEverything Else\\nService was...not great but that's kind of to be expected with this kind of place. Was a bit hard to flag someone down but service was fast in general. On the positive side, the interior was a lot cleaner and in better shape than almost all similar places as they tend to be on the older side. Lots of free parking in the back and on the street as well.

Tricky that there are two entrances, and you are suppose to enter on your left. Walked in...Half the restaurant was filled. The server asked us how many after he served another table and sat us by the wall...in the section in the front..so you can feel the \\"italy\\" hotness I guess. I think my friend had a good view...of the people behind me and out the window. I on the other hand had the view of the wall and its decorations. Quick to bring menu, water, bread. Bread is okay.

Too dry.\\n\\nMy friend's pasta? Half of it was cold. Like it had been sitting there...waiting to be ordered. The other half, thank god was warm. She didn't enjoy her pasta...so we both pondered why.. \\n\\nKind of shocked as to why no one asked how our food was. I always get asked. And usually I have a good answer. \\n\\nI won't be returning.

I'm not talking about chefs wearing full-on culinary school aprons or picnic tables draped in white linen, I'm talking about the way their food looks. Each meal comes out carefully constructed, neatly wrapped or boxed, with a photo-worthy platter of colorful, fresh-looking ingredients. They get an \\"A\\" for presentation here. And whatever you order, it smells inviting. All the more reason to dig in with a voracious appetite.\\n\\nThe staff sure can craft some distinctive flavors. I can't strictly categorize the food as Asian fusion, even though the names of their menu items would suggest it. Everything tastes somewhat different than what I would expect Asian fusion to be, and that difference ends up being a plus. The food ranges from good to delicious, depending on what you order. I've been most impressed with the pork belly banh mi, as both a burrito (where the ingredients pack tightly together and create a more intense flavor) and as a bowl (where you get a more deconstructed version that lets you sample each ingredient on its own, plus you get a fried egg). The pork belly is outstanding - it has this creamy texture and flavor that makes it seem like a delicacy. It's their best meat, and I probably haven't had it better elsewhere. For the Asian-style flavors, the daikon carrot and sriracha mayo are always fresh and add some nice contrast to the meat. The rice is terrific too. This is my go-to order whenever I show up here.\\n\\nI've had their Chinese BBQ burrito with chicken as well. It was very good, but not spectacular like the pork belly. The chicken was high-quality and cooked well, and the flavors were strong, but it didn't quite come together for me. Still worth trying. The BBQ brisket burrito was the most odd and disappointing one so far. Nothing about it was bad, though the brisket was a little dry. It was simply that the ingredients didn't work together: They put an apple slaw and peach BBQ sauce in with the brisket, which is certainly adventurous, but each item would do better on its own. I couldn't bring myself to like it - this weirdly sweet burrito was just too far a departure from tried-and-true BBQ. \\n\\nOverall though, this truck is a must-try. I haven't visited the brick-and-mortar on Burnet, and they have a different menu, so I can only endorse the truck. The prices here are practically unbeatable for the quality you receive. They aren't always out and about, which makes them difficult to run down most of the time, but eating their food is an experience you'll thank yourself for later."},{"name":"Boxer Ramen","address":"2605 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Eh, I've had better.

We opted to sit outside over the lounge, I prefer heat and flies over loud people. Our waiter was very nice and helpful with questions about the menu, very prompt refilling drinks, delivering food, etc. Food itself... mostly just very rich and salty, don't come here if you're on a diet or trying to be. \\nWe started with saut√©ed peppers that were mostly just bitter from being burned, the included mushrooms were my favorite part. \\nWe got brussels sprouts to split. They were rather tasty, I enjoyed the sweetness from the golden raisens, I didn't find them too salty.\\nMy mother got the duck breast. She found the meat itself a little tough but really enjoyed the cardamon orange sauce as well as the saut√©ed turnips.\\nI got the slow cooked beef shoulder. Lots of butter and salt went into that. The meat itself was very tender and practically fell apart, in a good way. Mashed potatoes were tasty but almost too liquidy to eat. Glazed root vegetables added a much needy sweetness. The sauce/gravy is where the saltiness came into play. Lots of salt and butter, not as much natural flavor. \\nOverall not the best experience, much better places in Austin, even ones right down the road!"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite Austin restaurant!

My boyfriend (who has gluten sensitivity) is always looking for new spots with good takes on gluten-free foods and figured we try this place out, out of all the Italian restaurants in North End.  \\n\\nIt's a very cute, pretty small restaurant off Salem.  We were here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon on a chilly day (sitting next to a real fireplace was super nice) and didn't have to wait at all.  Now, I don't have a gluten sensitivity and Giorgio's isn't only known for gluten-free.  Their bread isn't gluten-free but is so so good with the olive oil + Parm + chili (even he snuck a bite because it's so amazing :P).  I made out like a bandit by ordering a $7.95 lunch special which let you have any combination of their 5 plates for the day.  For me, I had eggplant parm, spinach lasagna, chicken stew, pulled pork, and tri-color fusilli with ricotta; all on one huge plate with enough for another meal!!

The toppings are fresh and well portioned and the bun is toasted perfectly. It was warm, juicy but not soggy and each bite was the perfect combo of everything I asked for on my burger. What was given to me is, in my opinion, the best burger in town based on the patty alone. \\n\\nIs it healthy? Oh God no. And for something to taste like this, it can't nor should it be.

They take 20 minutes to make and it's a shack of a joint so don't come back here [to Yelp] and whine about the service and that it was slow. It's not a Michelin Star restaurant, it's a burger place in East Austin where people go when they have the time and patience to sit around, have a Mexican Coke and wait for something good and while they may (as mentioned here) not always get your order right, unless you have a food allergy, get over it and eat the thing.

Based on the other reviews plus our experience here, I would say this place can be characterized as generally inconsistent at best, and much too expensive for the food quality, particularly for this neighborhood.  We arrived on a Friday evening about 6 pm and there was one car in the parking lot.  Not a good sign, but we didn't want to look for another place to eat, so we went for it.  The restaurant is located in a small new building across the street from a condo unit that is still under construction (we were expecting old-Montopolis/Oltorf sketchy area).  It's a small restaurant, maybe 12 - 15 tables plus about 6 bar stools.  There is not really any decor to speak of, it is pretty spare.  We sat at the bar, and as another reviewer noted, the bar is strangely high.  We got friendly, attentive service from the bartender.  I had a frozen margarita with a floater of some kind of liqueur (they didn't have Grand Marnier), and it was really good, but it ended up costing $20: $12 drink plus $8 floater.  Pretty expensive.  The chips are awful, dry and tasteless, very obviously not fresh.  The salsa is awful: just pureed chile sauce without anything else, no onion, garlic, etc.  I ordered the combo enchilada plate with 3 types of mole enchiladas plus black beans and rice.  I appreciate the fact that making most moles from scratch is a time-consuming task, but $18 for 3 enchiladas is pretty steep.  That said, each mole sauce and its enchilada filling was paired well and really delicious.  They made  a yellow mole sauce with chile gueros, (which I had never heard of) and it was great on the shrimp-filled enchilada.  Black beans and accompanying rice were alright, but nothing special.  The main issue was that the plate of food arrived lukewarm, not piping hot, and I was only steps from the kitchen.  A couple of strange things that indicate a lack of professional management: the door to the kitchen opens into the door of a cooler that is right inside the kitchen, which poses a logistical problem for everyone entering the kitchen (watching the plate and tray juggling was entertaining); the young daughter of an employee was allowed to lay/play on/sleep on the bench behind a table; the \\"manager\\" sat at a table looking at her laptop and did not make a move to help or supervise at any point during our visit.  This place may make it in the long run, once the new condo unit is finished and more upscale consumers gentrify the area, but it is much too expensive for the current neighborhood and it's just not that good.  Whomever is running the William Cannon location of this restaurant (which gets much better reviews) needs to spend some serious time here and straighten things out.  Their mole sauces make me hope they can get it together."},{"name":"H√§agen-Dazs","address":"1148 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Now before I get started here, let me tell you that it's really hard to screw up a sandwich.

That being said though, Lindsay's really knows what they're doing with sandwiches. \\n\\nThis was literally the healthiest meal I've had since I moved here to Colorado. My sandwich was stuffed to the core with veggies. Now see, I'm a carnivore and me and veggies don't really get along all too well, but Lindsay's actually made it edible for me. Maybe it's because they chop up their veggies nice and fine so that instead of getting huge chunks of veggie flavor, you're getting lots of little tiny bits and it all blends together to make this amazing flavor sensation. \\n\\nDefinitely a pretty good choice for lunch if you're in the downtown Boulder area.

Sweet Auburn's permanent location is at the Sweet Auburn Curb Market downtown, Atlanta's oldest public market.  Sweet Auburn serves Southern BBQ with Asian, French, and Mexican influences.  They do a lot of catering.\\n\\nThe food truck menu offers a small sampling of their full menu:\\n\\nTexas Sandwiches ($6) - smoked pork or brisket on Texas toast\\nBBQ Plate ($8) - smoked pork or brisket with Texas toast and a side\\nAuburn Taco ($3) - 6\\" flour tortilla with smoked pork or brisket topped with Asian pear coleslaw\\nVeggie Plate ($6) - choice of three sides\\n\\nThe sides are $2 each and include Asian pear coleslaw, baked potato salad, honey baked beans, and sweet potatoes.  If the sides are $2 each, then I'm not sure what the idea is behind the \\"Veggie Plate\\" since it's three sides for $6 and you don't save any money.  Maybe they're just trying to highlight the sides or show vegetarians an option.\\n\\nThe food truck's menu isn't the most creative or exciting in the world, but not all food trucks have to serve fusion and be witty and original.  Some good quality, traditional smoked meat can be had here.  I had the Auburn Taco with beef brisket.  The taco was made to order and the beef was pulled into thick, hearty chunks.  It was topped with fresh, shredded white slaw and crinkle-cut dill pickles with red chili seeds mixed in.  The soft flour tortilla held the taco together well, despite the voluminous amount of ingredients piled on top.\\n\\nI thought it was a decent-tasting taco.  The cooks were very generous with the amount of brisket, so each bite was quite meaty.  I liked the slaw, particularly the crisp and sour pickles.  With the amount of meat in the taco, you should probably add some sauce, of which Sweet Auburn offers a few self-serve bottles (BBQ sauce).\\n\\nService was great and the food was served up quickly."},{"name":"New Jumbo Seafood Restaurant","address":"5 Hudson St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I booked a reservation for at least twenty people one week ago and knowing that the restaurant is tight, I imagined that it would be split between a large and medium table. When we got there, the male host, about 5ft11in tall, about 50 years old, asked for my information and sat me down. I was there early and was shocked that he provided me with two small tables that were tight. I asked him why this was and if we could take the obviously empty and largest table they have, but it was reserved. I thought that as a host, or at least a manager, they would be efficient and practical. He replied in anger and said \\"You never called a week ago, this is all I can give you.\\" And I did call a week ago, my phone was on their records and he got mad at me for no reason. This type of management when the boss is not here drives customers away. Also, allowing chefs to smoke inside and having the smell enter the dining area seems unsanitary.

Their noodle soup bowls are like twice to three times as big as my head. Always have leftovers. For the price you pay, you can share with another person and maybe have another meal at home so very cheap if you think of it that way. Portions are good. I'm personally not a fan of their drinks besides Thai Ice Thea. Can come here solo, with another person, or group of friends. It's a self-serve cafe. Meaning they will bring out your food for you but it's up to you to serve yourself water/hot water (in front of the registers), put away your dishes, and throw away your trash. No tips are needed but still can be nice or give them a Christmas card. They are always friendly and customer service is always on point. If this was located in the heart of Allston... they would be overwhelm with so many customers! Ambience is always nicely decorated, a homie feeling.

It took close to 15mins to arrive and the server dropped an egg, while placing the plate on the table. Yes, I was pretty irate at this time since the service has been slow and I'm running late and now half my food is on the table instead of my stomach. So, the sever asked if he can bring me another egg. I said no it's ok I'm late, and I need my check. I quickly started eating my food, he brought the check, I used my free breakfast card, and I signed the form. He was nice and brought me another poached egg despite me telling him I didn't need one. I still ate it, and it tasted nice. Overall, the food quality wasn't bad, but the service is too slow especially for a hotel restaurant. People are coming and going and need to get places. No one has over 45mins waiting to be seated, order, get their food, and eat.

Bad service right off the bat. We ended up being seated in the bar area and it was pretty slow when we got there around 1:30 pm. Once again the service was slow. I'm not expecting speed of light service here, just a soda sitting in front of me at least 7 minutes after I sit down would be cool. To much to ask for? We ordered the onion rings to start. The rings were pretty good. We did make one comment on how the onion could had been a bit sweeter but the batter was spot on being made of Widmer brew. They came with a nice dipping sauce that was made of blue cheese and BBQ sauce I belive. It added perfect flavor to the fried goodness. We ended up ordering more than we should had probably but that is never really a bad thing. A wood-fired pizza with chicken and tomato was rather salty. Trust me I love my salt. But even I thought this was a bit over the top. The crust was nice and thin but did I mention it was satly. The topping were of quality. The best was probably the bacon cheeseburger that I ordered. The meat was cooked just how I like without me even having to ask. The bacon was thick and crisp and all the other standard toppings were fresh. I also have to say that this burger had the best bun that I have had in a long time. It was prefect and really help up well. I loved it.\\nThe fries were not so good. SALTY. Why so salty? But the crisp factor was nice on them.  Hey, I ate them anyway. Pickle on the side. \\n\\nStanfords was ok. I am sure we will go back again and give it another try.  They seemed to be trying hard. We over heard some other lunch goers complaining about how bad the soup was. The waiter brought them out the other soup selection and they still said it was not up to ideal standard. The waiter then explained that the entire kitchen staff had quit recently and that Stanfords was getting back to the way there recipes should be made.

I don't seem to remember them being as good at Delicious Kabob's, but 1) they're cheaper and 2) I may have hyped up my memory of DK's kabob's to unrealistic levels. Nevertheless, I still liked these kabobs because, really, you can't go wrong with meat-on-a-stick. Even the \\"sausage,\\" (which turned out to be a hot dog cut into florets) wasn't bad because it was prepped like the other meat.  Some may find this repetition tiresome, but since I liked the preparation, I didn't. For the record, the lamb was our favorite.\\n\\nThus scored the meat. How about the vegetables? The corn was awesome. Again, spicy and smokey, since these entire cobs were prepped the same as the meats. We loved them, though Mexican elote still has it beat.

C'mon, Chico and Chang's, let's see you try that!)\\n\\nOur server explained the $.50 items that dominated the right side of the menu. OK, she kind of explained; I inferred the rest, but only because I used to teach conversational English to foreign students. My companion Cindy had no idea what the server was talking about; you might have the same experience.\\n\\nAnyway, you can order the $.50 items, but first, you have to order in batches of 6. Second, they come in a hot pot broth. Some of these items faired better than others. The napa cabbage was tasty as were the beef balls. The woodear obviously lost its crunchiness and the some of the other meats lost their smokey goodness when dipped in hot pot broth. And the chicken jane was....ok. (I think they were chicken gizzards honestly.) There's still much to choose from though.\\n\\nLastly, Cindy loved the squid-on-a-stick. I thought it tasted a bit too fishy for me, but again, I was in the third trimester of a food baby. I'm not sure I would've liked anything at that point. Our final bill turned out to be around $40 with tip which was a little high compared to other Buford Highway eating Cindy and I do, but they're not Buckhead prices.  It may not be Delicious Kabob, but I'll take it.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4."},{"name":"TenOak","address":"409 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"This place is terrible.

I decided to go here for my birthday dinner and was educated about the Shula Cut and the very high standards used in selecting their beef.  The New York Strip was of excellent quality but it is not seasoned in anything other than melted butter. I am not a fan of this approach (see Ruth Chris as well). I think the right seasoning can really enhance the steak experience while an over buttered steak can tend to be greasy and linger omitting from your pores for hours to come. In summary, an excellent steak with no enhanced flavor. Shula's, unlike other price gauging steakhouses, includes two sides with the steak. Regretfully, I felt I overpaid for the included \\"free\\" sides. The baked potato was not cooked the same day or if it was it was cooked many hours earlier. It was served room temperature with an old taste. This should never occur in a good steakhouse. The brussel sprouts with bacon were undercooked and hard. I ate one bite and passed on the rest. Boston Market has a limited side of brussel sprouts and they were ten times better. The bread that accompanied the meal was ordinary as well.

A small box of 7 chicken wings costs $7 which means a dollar per wing, but my issue is how scrawny the chicken wings are. There is barely any meat on the chicken, there is almost no point in buying them. Also, yesterday when I went (Friday around 5:15pm) the young girl had just got in and was taking off her coat and getting situated. The elderly man who was running the front was opening a bag containing canned sodas. He goes to throw the bag away in the trashcan, but he had to push the trash can flap open to put the bag in and his hand touched it. This trashcan is the same trashcan that customers use to throw away food which means there are plenty of germs on it. My concern is that he is also touching food with those hands, as he never washed his hands afterward, he just continued to organize the food and drinks. At the same time, this is the same risk that we take when we eat at fast food restaurants, but that did turn me off to stay away from here for a while. Furthermore, from a customer service standpoint he completely ignored me standing there and I had to wait for the young girl to get situated before I was assisted.

Diner/'merican food served up vegan. Maybe a bit on the healthier side, but ultimately prioritizing taste/comfort. Good portions and cheaper prices tend to be characteristic of this food as well, but in the case of Veggie Galaxy, not so much\\n.\\nI get it. You are in a very expensive neighborhood/location and are probably using more premium ingredients. Running a restaurant is expensive, and that is often reflected in the cost of dishes, which I think is definitely the case with VG. It is for this reason I feel sort of guilty for getting bummed at VG's high prices and often smallerish portions, but honestly I can't help it.\\nGive me a burger and fries, serve it to me the way the other diners do, and yeah, maybe if you use some nicer ingredients you can reflect that in the price. Where I think VG trips up is taking this 'premium diner' food idea too far. They often make dishes too 'fancy', therefore necessitating a higher price which I think ultimately pushes people away (I know it does for me at least).\\nIf I could give one piece of advice, I would say try to keep things more simple. This is diner food. There are nicer/higher scale restaurants that people can go to for more expensive meals. People do not want to pay such high prices for things like burgers and fries, eggs/toast or a seitan cutlet.\\nThe same can be said for portions. If you are going to continue to charge the same amount for food, portions should be upped a bit. I will often defend expensive prices at restaurants by saying, \\"but they give you so much food!\\", but at VG I can't do that. \\"Well, I guess it tastes better than the burger at Tasty Burger?\\"\\n\\nOverall I have always been a fan of the food here, and the deserts are seriously on another level.

Chicken and tequila shrimp? I'll take it! I sat and sat found a girl, got a family started, raised my kids, sent them off to collage, ahhh my food has arrived. At first glans it looked appropriate for a king, some rice a chicken some shrimp and some green stuff. but very much like women it's not what you see it's what you taste. Uhhh ok scratch that. My first bite was sprinkle of rice, I was baffled! dry as a cockroach! How dare they! I take my knife and swing it for....the chicken, sliced a tad and took a nibble. Was this going to be a misery! Bland I tell you! Oh and a bit dry but that green sauce that tasted of freshly squeezed garlic made up for it, luckly I wasn't going on a date for the next couple years. The shrimp tasted shrimpy.

I was even more excited when I read that it was \\"diner-like.\\" \\n\\nBreakfast is served all day and you can choose a \\"burger\\" named after Cambridge neighborhoods or build your own.  The \\"burger\\" was a choice of black bean or mushroom chick pea.  My mother chose the former and I, the latter.  The items to add to the burger were delightfully unique: sweet potato mash, tarragon pesto, purple cabbage slaw (which is also a side choice), corn and apple salsa or roasted eggplant.  \\n\\nI opted for the tarragon pesto, cheddar cheese (which can be vegan) and the slaw.  The burger was hearty and tasted delish.  The  only thing that would have made it better would have been a mutli-grain bun. My mother loved her burger as well. I wished the onion rings were something to rave about; they were too greasy and had too much batter.  \\n\\nI saved 1/2 my burger for later just so I could have a slice of carrot cake from the vegan bakery.  It was fantastic!  I had traces of beets and the frosting was lemony and not too sweet. \\n\\nInitially, I was going to stop in and just get a sandwich to-go since my mother was with me and said she wasn't really hungry.

I came here on Valentine's Day with my significant other, they had a great deal going on for the night. Table side guac, 2 appetizers(one beef, and one shrimp) stuffed and fried tortilla, choice of any entree, and a desert(cheesecake or churros) all for $40 a person. Normally the table side guac is $20 alone, and the entrees are around $15-25 a dish. All worth it, the food was delicious!!! But the deal made it even better! I had the Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos, they were amazing. It tasted so fresh and the jalapeno sauce on it was just the perfect amount of kick. My boyfriend got the chicken and steak fajitas which he also said was so tasty. The portions were just the right size leaving us both full and satisfied with almost no leftovers. \\n\\nHow can you go to a Mexican restaurant and not try the margaritas?? You can't! I had the original and Peppercorn Pink Pomegranate-- soo good!! The bartenders hand was just heavy enough so you could taste the tequila but wasn't overpowering. \\n\\nI have no complaints about this place, besides that our table was extremely wobbly and there's not much space for walking through.

The piece of chicken breast was simi bone in with skin and cooked to perfection.  I have to say this was one of the best pieces of chicken I have ever had in a restaurant.   The skin was pan fried crispy and placed in a lovely pool of creamy mushroom filled marsala sauce.  It was served with a cheese risotto that I felt was very rich but a bit lack luster and had no stand out flavor.  It was a but much with the cream sauce so next time I might sub a plain pasta instead.\\n\\nWe ordered canoli to go.

The seafood was nice but 3 of each was not enough (yes yes, even if it's appetizer, a tad more would be better). \\n2. Entree: Saffron Seafood Linguini. The pasta was al dante. Very nice and the texture was very good and smooth-so to speak. The sauce was very light and simple, it didn't cover up the freshness of the seafood. I got 3 large shrimps, 3 more clams, and 3 more muscles. It was  very good and I enjoyed it very much. \\n3. Dessert: tiramisu. They gave you a good portion of it. The texture was very nice. Every flavor (cream, coffee, etc) was well balanced. However the aftertaste of the cream got fairly sweet. I also liked the three coffee beans which was nice and strong. \\n\\nOverall, very nice.

I had the Adriatic Sea and the H&S Bourbon Sling, and both were well priced at $10. The Sling was a bit too sticky sweet, but the Sea in particular was really refreshing (vodka, sake, St Germain, Prosecco), and I'm looking forward to the other half of the cocktail menu to be on offer (I have high hopes for the Pisco Sour and the Mint Julep). The boy had the Hops & Scotch, a rare beer, and a scotch (giant round ice cube = awesome), and was satisfied with the latter two but the H&S needs some work (just tasted like watered down scotch, he thought).\\n\\nFood:\\n-Scotch egg: get this. No questions, just do it. Amazingly delicious. Best part of the meal.\\n-Pork chop topped with apple-poblano chutney and a side of green beans with cherry tomatoes: excellent.

And enough food for a second meal, since we wanted to save room for dessert.\\n-Beer-braised short rib with mashed potatoes and charred corn: the boy enjoyed it. \\n-Chocolate bread pudding: the only dessert on offer tonight, it had some sort of chili in it that I wasn't a fan of (but I don't like spicy things anyways, so judge for yourself). Next time I'll try the fried pie when it's actually on offer, I bet it will be more to my liking. \\n\\nOur server was really friendly and attentive, and the owner plus other staff members also took the time to check in on us which was excellent- everyone seemed happy to be there.

The homeless gentlemen in the area are more than happy to point out the parking lot for you, but don't expect them to be happy when you have no cash to give them... \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is really nice, nicer than I was expecting even though I really didn't know what to expect. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, but we waited maybe 5 at the most. \\n\\nThe service was excellent and the food was pretty good. Between the 3 of us we got the 10 wings, \\"chicken and waffles\\" and a chicken steak over rice, smothered in gravy. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food a lot.

First stop, Italian food on the north end, of course.\\n\\nMamma Maria\\n\\nFood ***\\n\\nWe started with the meatball appetizer.  I had the filet with seared fois gras and fingerling potatoes.  Leslee had wild mushroom ravioli...after they informed us they were out of the lobster pasta. \\n\\nThe meatballs were average.  We both gave them a 'meh' rating. \\n\\nThe filet was a bit underdone for medium rare.  Not cool in the middle or worthy of a send-back, just a touch on the red side of pink for me.  It had a glaze that was pretty tasty, despite my general reluctance to sauce a steak.  This being my first experience with fois gras, I can't tell if it wasn't prepared well or I don't care for it in general.  It was not the rich, creamy goodness I was hoping for.  The potatoes were seasoned well and nicely done.\\n\\n\\"There were a lot of mushrooms, so good if you like that\\" is what I hear about the ravioli.  Being anti-fungus myself, I didn't try any.  Care to expand upon that, I ask?  \\"No show-stopper, but generally ok\\"; which I interpret as a mix of above average food and disappointment at not getting the dish she wanted.  A note on portion size - sounds like it wasn't enough, and that's no good coming from a tiny appetite.  \\n\\nService ****\\n\\nLet us know up front if you are out of something so there are no dashed expectations.  Otherwise, no complaints here.   The table was ready when we arrived and the service was prompt.\\n\\nAtmosphere **\\n\\nIt's a nice place, with upscale casual dining.  You'll be fine in jeans...unless our look was why they saw fit to sequester us:   The 2 star rating comes from our party of six being crammed into a little alcove that was made for a table of 2.  Can everyone get up and let me out so I can go to the restroom?\\n\\nValue ***\\nThe filet was fairly priced ($34); the pasta a bit on the high side given the portion ($26).  My sticking point here was the lack of moderately priced wine.  I'm not looking for bargain basement.  The prices started at ~$50 a bottle.  Each bottle we chose was good, but not noticeably better than any $35 bottle I've had in a quality Italian restaurant.  I did not price check the markup.\\n\\nIn closing...\\nI won't go so far as to call Mamma Maria a tourist trap, but I left feeling like I didn't make the most of my north end Italian food experience."},{"name":"Spinners","address":"14106 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I would definitely say don't go here for the seafood boil.

An added perk, my boy friend has the same last name as the place :)\\n\\nWe arrived for a late dinner at around 10 PM and the place was still bustling with people, which was a good sign, but as much as I wanted to like the place, I really couldn't. Al-wadi is to Middle Eastern Food what Olive Garden is to Italian food. A sad attempt at authenticity. Keeping it simple, we ordered the stuffed grape leaves and hummus for appetizers. Sadly the stuffed grape leaves were the best part of our meal. They were BOMB and probably the only thing that should stay on the menu unchanged when Al-wadi does a much needed revamping of all their recipes. The hummus was so SALTY it was inedible, leaving us desperate for our already delayed water refills. The fattoush I had been looking forward to was sub par and way too heavy on the radishes. My bf ordered the chicken kebab and rice dish which was unremarkable, dry, and slightly too salty as well. Our waitress kept bringing us glasses of red wine even though we ordered white and she argued with us about whether or not Chateau Musr made a white wine even though we showed her the menu which clearly stated this. Halfway through the meal, we were finally served our wine, but by this time we had become fairly disillusioned with the place and were ready to leave. The only difference between this place and an Olive Garden are the ridiculous prices.

I went with reasonable expectations. Reviews were glowing. The menu seemed unique. The location close to home.  So I went with my sister and we both left with the same feeling - meh, not coming back.\\n\\nWe ordered Chi Cheung and one build your own - fries,bacon and cheddar.   We approach the counter and begin our order. We had already read the menu from their site and new exactly what we were going to order. We ordered the burgers and were asked if this was our first time. Yes. The attendant then gave us free fries. He asked for our drink selections and then something strange happened. Another customer walked in and in the middle of taking our order the attendant stopped and took this new customers order in full.  He basically put us on hold.  He even got a discount for being from  the neighborhood.  I  have lived in East Austin all of my life and I get free fries.  Whatever.  Mark down.\\n\\nMoving on. We order the \\"wings.\\"  And finally our two drinks.  30 dollars and then some for the whole she-bang.  Mark down because without the free fries this would have taken a good deal more of my two 20s.\\n\\nFood takes about 30 minutes to come out. The wings are not wings they are drumsticks -- stringy and muscle-y.  The burgers are tasty but nothing special. The stuffed burger concept is nothing more than two quarter pound patties with cheese in between. My sister's burger comes with a slice of bacon burned into the bottom patty, no fries inside as she was led to believe, and overall just ho-hum.  My Chi-Cheung though original was nothing like the sum of it's parts would suggest. The Wasabinger was subtle and interesting.   The really truly great food we had were those fries.  They are dusted with a spice that makes them incredibly hard to put down.\\n\\nToo much money for too little impact.

On every other occasion that I've had La Barbecue it's been stunning. The fat is perfectly rendered into the meat until the meat glistens and drips a bit rather than having ribbons or chunks of fat running through it. The rub gets just enough salty and peppery flavors into the meat to light up those taste buds. Lastly, the smoke ring both looks and tastes amazing. It's a perfect example of the pinnacle of Texas brisket.\\n\\nThe other meat I've had here is good, but not so amazing.

Ye means coconut, Heung means fragrant, Zha Ji Gai loosely means fried chicken. Name in English is Coconut Deep Fry Crispy Chicken. This consists of pieces of fried chicken, Cantonese style with a sweet coconut sauce. \\nJu Yim Daai Fau Haai - Ju Yim literally means Hot Pepper Salt. Haai literally means crab. Daai Fau literally means Big Harbor, but it is also a term that the Chinese used to describe San Francisco's Chinatown. This is the Jumbo Crab cooked with Spicy Salt. Weight was 2 pounds when we got it. \\nTong Yun Gai Lan Ngau Youk - Beef with Chinese broccoli. I do not think it is on the regular menu, but I think if you said Beef with Chinese Broccoli, they will know what you are talking about. Tong Yun is an old term to describe a Chinese person (Tang Dynasty). Gai Lan means broccoli, while Ngau Youk means beef. \\nOne large bowl of white rice. \\n\\nThe lobster portions were really generous compared to other restaurants that serve it in this style. The Zha Ji Gai still continues to be really tasty, especially with the coconut sauce. The beef and Chinese broccoli was decent. I enjoyed eating the Daai Fau Hai, very tasty, although it does take up a significant amount of time to break through the shells to eat it and it can get messy. Although your hands get significantly greasy after eating it, the servers are nice enough to give you a small glass bowl of a dark liquid made from lemon, water, and other solutions to wash your hands and thick napkins to wipe your hands dry. Don't drink from it!\\n\\nOther the four dishes I have mentioned, the Ju Yim Sin Yau, (Spicy Salt Calamari, $10.95) is also pretty good here. The food is a bit pricey overall, ($10 a pound for the crab) but the portions are great, and definitely worth the money, especially if you bring a group of friends, which will make the dishes a lot more cheaper.\\n\\nMy four star rating still stands."},{"name":"Tanuki","address":"413 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Omakase!

Perfectly cooked, thick-cut.\\n\\nRainbow Trout - The sig substituted pomme frittes for the baby turnips, but kept the mustard greens, and literally the whole thing was so tasty, so well-seasoned. \\n\\nRoast Chicken - White meat, but so incredibly juicy, it was almost unreal. I couldn't identify the seasoning they used (which was surprising for me, cuz, I know my flavors) but it was amazing.\\n\\nWe finished the night off with aforementioned Sourdough Bread Pudding that came with a little bit of vanilla ice cream and was covered in this insane caramel sauce.

My matcha latte was $6 + tax. I'm guessing this is because they use the pure, unsweetened matcha, but even considering the quality I don't feel like the drink was worth the price.

The bowl included delicious bamboo shoots, seaweed, and green onions and comes with a huge side of pork cutlets and sauce - this was very tasty. I'm not sure if they had options for thin noodles, but this bowl comes with thick ones by default. I prefer thinner noodles, so I think that would've improved the experience overall.

Thankfully, the server was kind enough to add some coconut milk to my food, but not before everything in my body started to burn. Seriously, my medium spiced food was hotter than the Thai Hot others got. I love flavor and spices can add flavor, but when it's spice for the sake of being hot, I get turned off. The meal itself wasn't too bad, but I was so grateful Ryan R decided to get a mild dish and was willing to take over feasting duties on my selection. It's only too bad that the spice began a warfare on his body that involved his new best friend, the porcelain god.\\n\\nOf course, I can't quite fault the level of spice on the restaurant, and the flavors I could taste between the searing pain were delicious.

The only reason why I can't, is because there is a lack of available seating in the bar area, and if you don't get there by like 8, good luck getting a seat at the bar area.  It is also consistently extremely warm in this place, which makes it kind of uncomfortable.\\n\\nHowever, I am a huge fan of this place none-the-less.  I have heard some people complain about the food here, but I am a fan.  The hush puppy appetizer is great, and the burgers are delicious as are the fries.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but I plan to next time I go.  The servers are quick and friends, and will even make you little samples of cocktails on their menu if you ask them to.\\n\\nThe beer and scotch menu are more than adequate to anyone who enjoys the fruits of these two drinks.  This bar is one of only two that serve probably the best beer I have ever tasted in my life...the Lexington Kentucky Bourbon beer.  If you haven't had it, drop what you are doing right now and go get one...it's amazing.  The scotch is a bit pricey, around 10-15 bucks per drink, depending on the type of scotch you get.  I usually stick with my go-to, the Aberlour 12-year old single malt, but there is pretty much any type of scotch on the menu to serve any palette.  \\n\\nOverall, reasonably priced and a great addition to the bars in Brookline."},{"name":"Culver's","address":"3148 N Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"First time trying this fast food place.

Though the owners have taken a great deal of time to design the space as sophisticated and friendly as possible, don't let that fool you. I have visited this shop on three different occasions and each time received the same type of service - NONE! I visited this past weekend and the gentlemen in front of me was helped and when his order began to take longer than the clerks had expected, she chose to simply ignore the fact that she had another customer waiting. Instead of acknowledging me saying \\"I'll be right with you,\\" she simply chose to pretend as if I wasn't there. Finally, when I saw the Executive Pastry Chef come out front from the kitchen (through the glass window), I figured he was coming out to lend a hand. He was, to another gentlemen who JUST walked through the door and was now in line behind me. Obviously a frequent guest, given their casual encounter, but nonetheless chose to ignore that I was a customer in line waiting for service. My other visits yielded similar service issues. The first time, myself and two other customers stood in line for 5 minutes while no one was there to serve us and no one in the kitchen came out to assist. The second time, there were two workers at the counter but only one doing work, chatting away with the other while a long line of customers waited...I wasn't the only one upset that day. \\n\\nThough I'm certain the food is tasteful, I wouldn't know...I have never been given the opportunity to try it. I am a South End resident and strongly support the neighborhood shops and retail stores, but I not when it's apparent that there are no service standards in place. It's obvious why Flour, just down the block, has a line out the door while Aroa tends to look abandoned each time you pass by."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Before coming down to Austin, I went on a research mission to find great barbecue with a short wait. Since I was only visiting for one day, I didn't want to waste 5+ hours of my time waiting in line for food (*cough* Franklin's *cough*), but I also didn't want to compromise quality. After looking at numerous lists and reviews, I decided to go with la Barbecue since people claim that it is as good as Franklin's (if not better) and that it doesn't require the same ridiculous waiting time. Even after deciding on la Barbecue, simple economics made me skeptical of the claims. Surely great food warrants a long wait time so either I was going to wait longer than expected or the food wasn't going to be as good as people claimed, right? Wrong...\\n\\nI arrived to la Barbecue about 1.5 hours before they opened (on the Saturday of ACL). From what I read, the average wait time was around 1.5 hours so I figured that I might as well wait before they open and be one of the first people to get food as opposed to coming later, waiting 1.5 hours anyways, and arriving to front to find out that they are sold out of some items. This decision turned to work out great for me. We were about the fourth group of people there so there wasn't much of a line in front of us. Also, since we were early we were able to get a parking spot in the lot in front of the bar next door instead of having to find a street spot. For some of you 1.5 hours of waiting may still seem ridiculous, but it really wasn't bad at all. The time passes by quickly if you're with a group of friends. Also, for you drinkers, they offer free beer as you wait. The line didn't ever appear to get too long, but I'd guess that the wait time is as advertised because of the processing time when people are ordering. That being said, they have a smart system in that you order in one spot and pay around the corner. I'm sure that helps keep the line moving as quickly as possible. Also, it should be noted that they do pre-orders. A wedding group of about 15 people did that and got their food immediately.\\n\\nWhen it was our turn, we ordered 2 pounds of brisket, a beef rib, potato salad, and chipotle slaw. The sides were good, but nothing out of this world. I probably wouldn't get any sides if I went again and just save every ounce of my appetite for the meat. The brisket is incredible! In fact, their brisket spoiled me because it has made me super critical of any brisket I have eaten since then. Even though the brisket was great, the beef rib is somehow much better! Next time I'll be ordering more of the beef rib than brisket, but nonetheless, both meats were cooked and seasoned perfectly!\\n\\nSimply summarized, la Barbecue's delivers top notch quality barbecue with a relatively short wait. I can't make any comparisons to Franklin's since I've never eaten there, but it's hard to imagine barbecue getting any better than this. Also, they do pre-orders; however, they took a while to reply to my e-mail inquiry."},{"name":"Mamma Maria","address":"3 North Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Super romantic setting is perfect for an evening with a loved one.

The restaurant is a bit cramped and stuffy, so we thought we were very lucky to get a light breeze.\\n\\nMamma Maria is definitely pricey. It isn't a place I'd become a regular at because even though the food is tasty, it isn't worth $90+ for two small plates of pasta, one beer, and one martini. They have a limited menu, so we ordered the pasta with scallops and the mushroom raviolis. No apps, salad, or dessert and we paid a little over $115 including tip. \\n\\nWaitress wasn't very friendly. She was rather short with us and only returned to see if my date wanted another beer and to give us the check. I took one tiny sip of my pisco sour and placed it to the side. It was bitter and was unlike any martini or mixed drink I've had before. Yes, it was strong, but it had a really funky taste. The waitress never asked how I liked my drink or if there was anything wrong with it. I didn't complain or ask for another. I simply paid the $10+ for it.

He said his coffee was delicious and not bitter like most dark roast coffee. My supreme biscuit was delicious, every bite scrumptious. My tea was amazing as well.

For the salad, if you don't mind the skimpiness on tomatoes (1 grape tomato) and 3 thin slices of white onion on a bed of lettuce, you'll be fine.  It really is good value for money.

Promising delectable dishes at cheap prices. Too bad when my mom and I walked into this one and decided to have dinner, the latter rang true and only that.  Before I get to how insanely awful our food was, I would like to mention  the overall decorative design of the place. Attempting to have a conversation with my mom over what to order, I found myself being distracted and disgusted by the 1980s poster of New Kids On The Block. There's just nothing appealing about looking at Marky Marc's chest hair when deciding between chicken fingers and a burger. The other posters of local celebrities weren't as disturbing. They just need to update the place and consider their customer's sensitive stomachs. \\n\\nThe wait for our food, didn't take too long. I figured out why, my mom's order was completey wrong in every way possible and my chicken tenders tasted like they were leftovers that they  heated up in an easy bake oven for 10 minutes. The fries were confusing, some were crispy while others were saggy.  My public high school cafeteria had better fries than this. We got through a few minutes of our meals, toughing through, not wanting our money to go to waste and we finally decided to ask for the check.\\n\\nThe two stars for the restaurant is for the waiter. He was very nice and made me feel guilty about not taking my leftovers home.  I know that there are certain expectations of chain restaurants and I shouldn't have such high hopes, but  this Applebee's didn't even live up to the minimum expectations. Applebee's needs to be redmodeled and the food should match it's waiters."},{"name":"Waba Korean Restaurant","address":"228 Schoolhouse Street, Suite 8","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"4.5","text":"Friendly and helpful service...delicious food...

However, since they've opened up the new location, this location is a shadow of its former self. They've done away with their sushi-¬†yep, you heard correctly. The only pieces of sushi you can get are the 4 pieces that come with your bento box. They've also taken wine off their menu-¬†very disappointing! \\n\\nIt's now more of a lunch spot (though they're open for dinner) serving bento boxes and ramen. I'm a fan of ramen, just not when it's 102 degrees outside. While they did post a sign that says \\"New Menu\\", it would be more appropriate to say \\"Drastically Different Menu!\\" Yelp should definitely remove the \\"Sushi Bars\\" tag. On the bright side, I do enjoy the Beef Bulgogi bento box. Portions are generous and they've kept our favorite appetizers on the menu-¬†the Gyoza dumplings and Kara Age. \\n\\nThe service is good, though the last two times we've been there, they've only staffed two servers during dinnertime, and they often seem frazzled if they have several tables seated at the same time. Luckily, that doesn't seem to be a big problem, since they're no longer nearly as busy.\\n\\nSeeings as I'm rating the current restaurant, not what it used to be, I give it 3 stars (formerly 5). While you can visit the new location farther down by the 360 and 183 junction, the prices have increased quite a bit (assuming because of the bigger restaurant, full bar and increased overhead) and it's a completely different atmosphere.

We passed this place several times since we live in the area so I was really stoked to try this place out. \\n\\nThe restaurant can certainly be called a \\"dive\\" and in my past experiences that *usually* means the food and service are totally awesome. Unfortunately today was not the case...I didn't see a \\"seat yourself\\" sign when we first walked in but there were people waiting in line to order to go orders. My fianc√© and I do see people seated with menus so I do a casual search of the place and see a stack of menus by the register.

I noticed several globs on mine and did my best to avoid it....\\n\\nI ordered the enchiladas and it said on the menu it came with my choice of beef or chicken. I said beef and our waitress asked me what kind of beef. She points to my option on the menu and tells me it says my choice of Between THREE BEEFS and Chicken. (I'm thinking how the hell am I suppose to know because their beef options aren't exactly listed) I settled on beef fajita. My fianc√© orders some sort of burrito and said he wanted chicken. Our waitress mumbled \\"it comes with chicken\\" and continued taking our order....\\n\\nMy food came out first and it was a good looking plate. My fianc√©'s plate hadn't come out and I hated to start without him so I waited. We were both pretty hungry so we started nibbling on the chips and we were both dipping in my queso sauce, the beans, and the rice.  He prompts me to starting eating because he's food STILL hasn't come out yet at this point. I'm about half way through my enchiladas and I just put down my fork. I can't believe he's food STILL wasn't out. Our waitress hadn't come by to give us a status update, nothing. He goes up the counter where both waitresses are just leaning on the counter, and they tell him they are still waiting on the cook.  \\n\\nTell me why the next two plates to come out were to a table that got there not 15 minutes ago!?

Our waitress took our order, made us feel stupid for not knowing their menu. Our waitress came back two different times to ask us questions I feel like she should have asked at the time she took our order. No joke. She came back and asked me if I wanted corn or flour tortillas, and came back a second time to ask my fianc√© what kind of sauce he wanted on his burrito. \\n\\nThe ONLY reason this place is getting 2 stars is because the food is decent.

They were tiny and stuffed badly, straight out of the can and super watery, with hardly any stuffing or flavor whatsoever for $1.95 each, talk about a bust. We also got the complementary bread, mozzarella sticks, and bruschetta, and the bread was basically some store-bought buns with little butter packets, the bruschetta was fairly tasty but mostly due to the garlicky cheese (the tomatoes looked pretty unripe and not at all fresh); I didn't sample the mozz sticks but the verdict was that they were decent. The salads were simple but pleasant due to the amount of dressing. What really won us over was the pasta- the red sauce is HEAVENLY. The Alfredo is halfway decent, but the meatballs & red sauce spaghetti & the lasagna are what earned this place 3 stars instead of 2.

For our entrees we had the scampi steak & NY strip steak. For sides we went with mac&cheese, carrots, and mashed sweet potatoes. The carrots were... interesting lol but not in a bad way just not what i thought it would be. Everything else was amazing. The ambiance was upscale and sexy. They have an elevator & stairs that leads you to the second floor dining room which was super convenient for me with heels on.

Will definitely be coming back again."},{"name":"Tang Dynasty","address":"18070 NW Evergreen Pkwy, Unit C","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"4","text":"At the strong recommendation of a foodie friend, my wife and I came here on a Friday night. We had high hopes as our friend mentioned that this place has the same owner as Duck House in downtown, which we've been to multiple times and enjoyed the food there.\\n\\nThe online waitlist feature was rather interesting - we placed ourselves in the waitlist when we were about to head out, though we did arrive a little later than when it told us to get there. Maybe that's why we had to wait in line another 20 minutes? They did offer us bar seating but we wanted a table, and the restaurant was very busy indeed with people waiting outside the door.\\n\\nAnyway, they eventually seated us and we ordered:\\n- Mung bean jelly (appetizer)\\n- Maoxuewang (spicy stew of pork intestines and beef tripe)\\n- Twice cooked tofu\\n- Two bowls of rice (they charge for rice; it's a rather common practice nowadays to charge for rice, I think it's done in China too)\\n\\nThe person taking our order (seemed like he was also the owner/co-owner?) then said a bunch of things about checking if we've ordered enough to qualify for another dish for $5, which was very confusing... until he came back and brought a small menu of 8-ish items for $4.99 each, including Chong Qing hot chicken, which he recommended. We decided to order the broccoli chicken instead.\\n\\nMung bean jelly:\\nIt came out warm, to our surprise (Taste of Sichuan serves it cold). The sauce had a slight floral taste and slight numbing sensation due to the presence of Sichuan peppercorn oil, which was quite pleasant. There were hunks of other whole spices in there as well - watch out and don't bite into them! Overall tasty, not as spicy as Taste of Sichuan's (though that one burns your face off, so it's probably a good thing that it's not as spicy).\\n\\nPork intestine and beef tripe stew:\\nWow, the size of the bowl! Serves a family of 4 at least (our neighboring table of 4 people ordered the same dish). Unlike most other places (cough Taste of Sichuan cough), the bowl was absolutely filled with actual intestine and tripe pieces, along with spam, pork blood, pieces of fish (which was unusual), and only a little bit of bean sprouts, cabbage, and mung bean noodles at the bottom. Enough for 3 meals for one person (and indeed the leftovers were enough for 2 meals). Absolutely delicious and a fantastic deal for $16!\\n\\nTwice cooked tofu:\\nThe tofu was first deep-fried then stir-fried (hence twice cooked); they were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, the accompanying cabbage, leeks, etc., all had a good sear/wok hei taste. A good dish.\\n\\nBroccoli chicken (the $4.99 dish):\\nTo my surprise, it was actually a full-sized dish, despite the discounted price. The broccoli florets still had good crunch and were nicely seasoned, the chicken pieces were tender but a little too salty. Not bad.\\n\\nSo far, everything seems to indicate a 4-star review (the stew was outstanding and everything else good), but what brought them to 5 stars was the service: aside from the rather unexpected $4.99 menu (maybe next time we'll try the Chong Qing chicken), this also takes into account our neighboring table's experience. They ordered meicai kourou (steamed pork belly with salted mustard greens), and were told that it would have to be made fresh and might take 20-30 minutes, to which they agreed. After around 15-20 minutes, the waiter (probably the owner?) came over and apologized for the wait, and brought out some egg flower soup for them for the wait. Maybe it's because they had two small (and very well-behaved) kids, but we felt that it was a nice touch from the restaurant.\\n\\nThe order came out to around $45, which we felt was a fantastic deal for the meal (plus at least 2 more meals of leftovers because there was simply so much food). The food overall was very good, well seasoned but not overly strong in any particular flavor (not too salty, not too spicy, not too greasy except the stew which is oily as it's supposed to be). The ambience was lively and the service was very good in our experience despite the rather chaotic dinner crowd at 6:30pm on a Friday. We will be back - and hopefully they keep up their standards and not go the way of so many other restaurants here!"},{"name":"Athan's Bakery","address":"1621 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I hate to do this (two star review)... especially since there was an older gentleman (older than most staff) there trying to straighten things out (perhaps a manager or owner?). \\n\\nThe atmosphere was nice (although the acoustics contributed to it being a little louder than I would prefer for a cafe/coffee shop), the coffee was good, and the egg & cheese panini just fine, but the service was so poor I can't justify even a three start rating. \\n\\nThis was my first visit I did not realize that the menu varies between the two locations (the website had a \\"cafe menu\\" listed at the time I checked and it did not specify that this was for the Brighton location only). Perhaps had I checked the website more closely I would have noticed... anyhow, it was handled poorly. A man a number of people ahead of me in line had made a similar mistake and had been told that although they didn't have a full menu, he could order a panini/pressed sandwich. Anyhow, when I arrived at the front of the line and tried to clarify the menu (just to be sure) I was told (in a blase tone) \\"We don't have a kitchen here.\\" And that was it... the girl did not explain the differences between locations or point me in the direction of the paninis. She just said \\"We don't have a kitchen here\\" and kind of looked away... clearly bored. When I asked about paninis she pointed at a menu on the counter. When I was ready to order she did NOT explain the process (order here and go wait by the coffee bar/counter); I had to ask where to pick up my food.  Throughout our interaction she was flat, unpleasant, and disinterested.  I found her rude... this is not the kind of customer service I expect at a well established cafe/coffee shop. \\n\\nAfter making my order I went to pick up my food. It took almost 45 minutes to arrive (and this was after the helpful gentleman mentioned above asked me what I was waiting for and spoke to the girls making the paninis/pressed sandwiches); the coffee (just regular coffee) took about 15+ minutes. I was never given a receipt, so no proof of purchase. The group seated next to us waited longer than we did because someone swooped in and took their paninis while they looked on helplessly (easy to do when no one asks you for a receipt and there are no names attached to the orders)!  What a poor system... especially on a weekend morning... utter chaos! No one apologized for the length of time or tried to give an explanation. \\n\\nAnyhow, like I said the coffee was good, the panini good. I might go back for a coffee to go if I'm in the neighborhood, but I'm not sure it would be worth the trouble. My opinion is they need better staff, a better system, and not to sell paninis if they can't manage making them in a timely manner. \\n\\nAnyhow, it wasn't all bad... I had good company.

Tufts had a large showing at the Pub that night, and I understand that it was a stressful and overcrowded situation, but cursing at patrons should never be tolerated. I've certainly had some great experiences with the staff in the past as the door people and the manager have been friendly and welcoming to me. However, this past time at the Pub will certainly be my last. After waiting for around 25 minutes to be served by a bartender because the management decided to only have 2 people working the bar while more than 200 students were crowded into the establishment, I finally placed my order along with another guest for a vodka cranberry and a pitcher of bud light. After the bar tender spent a good 5 minutes trying to find a clean pitcher, he finally returned and settled the bill for the pitcher of beer. He immediately turned away having forgotten my vodka cranberry, an honest mistake I can understand. Nonetheless, I went to a different spot on the bar to try and get the bartenders attention to alert him of the mistake. After incredibly calmly and politely explaining that I had just placed an order that he forgot to fulfill, he told me to \\"Go f**k yourself\\". Flabbergasted at his aggression I turned away. I have never been treated so brutally in my life for such an inexplicable reason. While noise and crowds are sure to disorient even the most experienced bartenders, cursing at a customer is completely intolerable behavior that should result in immediate disciplinary action by the management. As a once loyal patron of the Pub, I will not stand for such barbaric and callous behavior on the part of the staff."},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I recently went to this restaurant for the 1st time.

It would've been nice to provide a little saucer so that the table didn't look too messy and it would've been easier to collect everything afterwards. Our food was good - I was looking for more meat and what was supposed to be a soft poached egg was medium. The cutlery was dirty so I requested for new clean ones. My husband liked his meal, it was cheesy, gooey and the eggs he ordered was nicely done. The servers were really lovely - they apologized and asked us if we needed anything else. I don't mind if some things go wrong especially when the servers are amazing. Keep doing what you're doing and continue to wear your beautiful smiles. \\nSome constructive feedback for further improvement: serve creamers on a saucer and collect empty sachets. Wipe table, window seal and seats properly. Check sauce bottles and clean leftover spills. Lastly, please wash cutlery and check before wrapping them in napkins."},{"name":"Sejuiced Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1958 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Why on earth did it take me this long to check out this place?

Kim makes her own mayo, liver pate & meatballs everyday so its no surprise that she has such a loyal following. Everything that goes into her sandwiches are carefully orchestrated for maximum flavour right down to the garnishes and her choice of baguette. Warming up the sandwich in her convection oven heightens the culinary experience. We miss watching her make our sandwiches to order now that she working inside the kitchen of her brother's restaurant. We introduced our son to Kim's sandwiches when he was a tiny preschooler.

I've converted a number of my coworkers to Kim's sandwiches and they agree wholeheartedly with my review. Every other Banh Mi's made by other restaurants that we've tasted pale in comparison.

My friends and I all work downtown and love going to different happy hours where we can enjoy quality drinks and snacks on a budget.  The happy hour menu seemed on par with Ruth's Chris steakhouse where we love to go quite often.  Unfortunately the experience was less than wonderful, for the following reasons:\\n\\n1.  The service was terrible and there were only two other tables occupied the whole   time we were there.  Our server told us she was out of it, and proceeded to spend most of her time sitting with some guy at the bar.  My boyfriend asked her about a specific type of beer and she didn't know anything about it.  He went ahead and ordered it and it was terrible so he waited to let her know he wanted something else, but she never returned.  He ended up walking up to the bar to order a different drink.  When we paid out our tab was more than $100.  My boyfriend asked the waitress if she was going to comp the beer he didn't like and she said \\"no, if you don't pay for it, then I have to pay for it\\".  Needless to say we told her we would be happy to pay for it.\\n\\n2.  The happy hour drinks taste like bad kool-aid.  My friend and I ordered \\"The Executive Washroom\\" and \\"The Water Cooler\\"  respectively.  They were terrible.  We ended up ordering drinks from the regular menu which were much better.\\n\\n3.

Came out to about $15 something.\\n\\nMy burger was ready as soon as I finished pouring my fountain drink.  It was really fast.  My order came in a bag.  The ketchup containers were really large so 2 was enough.  The fries arrived in a cup, but it overflowed because I was given more than that.  Big portions are always a plus.  The fries were good and solid.  I ate all of them before getting to my burger.  The burger had two beef patties and flimsy bread, but amazingly it held up.  It was freshly cooked with no preservatives so it was a plus.  Pure unadulterated beef.  The other ingredients came together perfectly to make it taste real good.

Although I guess I shouldn't have been (cause we're not in Europe, after all) I was surprised it was almost completely empty.  There was one couple leaving, and another at the bar.  Normally I would think this a reflection of the restaurant, but given the day and the time I didn't put too much stock in it.\\n\\nI'm very conflicted about the atmosphere - there are elements I really like (the tables, chairs, bar, bottles of wine) but then there were parts that sullied it a bit (very strange artwork, a Sirius radio station playing chill electronica...not my cup of tea).

During the month of September restaurants around Orlando offer a 3 course menu for $35.  It's a great way for locals to check out some new restaurants and for restaurants to draw people in during a typically slow month.  On top of that a portion of the proceeds go to charity so it is a win win for everyone.  \\nItta Bena is located at Pointe Orlando which has a wide variety of restaurants to choose from.  The downside to this location is the parking.  There is both valet and a garage.  Itta Bena will validate your garage parking, but not valet.\\nThe name of the restaurant really threw a lot of us.  A couple of our friends thought we were going for Italian and my husband thought we were going for Japanese.  In actuality, it is the name of the town where BB King was born so the food it southern.  \\nWe chose to valet the car, not knowing it wouldn't be validated, and proceeded directly up the stairs to the restaurant.  It is located near it's sister locations of Lafayette's and BB Kings.  Unbeknownst to us the restaurant is also a piano bar and featured live music most of the night.  For the most part I really enjoyed the music, but be aware it wouldn't be the best place to catch up with a long lost friend as you may be yelling a bit.  \\nThe interior is cool and has that Louisiana Bayou feel to it with distressed wood and lights that look like old kerosene lights.  The menu has things like she crab soup, shrimp and grits, and baby back ribs.  \\nThere were 5 of us, plus my toddler.  They have high chairs and a limited kids menu with staples like mac n cheese and chicken tenders.  \\nAll of us ordered off of the MD menu and 3 of us ordered the optional wine pairing with MD.  I started with a blueberry lemon drop martini which was sweet and delicious.  A friend ordered the ruby red martini which was also very good.  \\nFor appetizers we had she crab soup, the IB salad, and crab cakes.  The she crab soup was the hit of the table.  My husband loved it and the toddler loved it more.  He ate 1/2 of it.  \\nFor entrees we had salmon, filet, and shrimp pasta.  Everyone enjoyed theirs and there were completely empty plates all around.  You would have thought they licked the plates clean.  My husband was incredibly impressed with his salmon.  My steak was perfectly cooked.  I really enjoyed the sauce that was on it so I asked for more.  The mashed potatoes were not my style.  They were lumpy with skins, but the baby liked them.  \\nFinally, for dessert we had fruit cobbler, brownie cheesecake and bread pudding.  My husband said the inside of the bread pudding was ok, but it was mostly hard and stale edges.  My cheesecake brownie was good, but not remarkable.  \\nOur server was very attentive at first. He offered to bring the baby's food with the appetizer.  We had ordered baked mac n cheese for him.  It did not come out with the appetizer, but the baby was digging the she crab soup so that was ok.  However, when our entrees arrived their was still no kid food.  A few moments later our server came by and asked how everything was and what he could get us.  I looked at my son and said, the macaroni.  He returned 5 minutes later with penne pasta with a white sauce, not baked macaroni and cheese.  It was piping hot so we couldn't give it it him right away, but I tasted it and thought it tasted pretty good.  However, it wasn't at all what we were expecting.  It definitely wasn't baked.  Whether is was a cheese sauce or more like an alfredo sauce was debated at the table, but it definitely wasn't the type of noodle I was expecting.  If you don't have kids this may seem inconsequential, but penne noodles are large and require me to cut them up into pieces before I can serve them.  Elbow or rotini pasta are already bite sized.  He can feed himself and I can enjoy my dinner.  Well he wasn't having it, so I wasn't going to just have them take it away.  He had eaten soup and mashed potatoes, but the manager came out with rotini and cheese from next door at Lafeyette and he happily dug into that so all's well that ends well."},{"name":"Community Smith","address":"866 W Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My first time at this restaurant.

But something has changed and it becomes more and more evident on every visit.\\n\\nThe once friendly staff is unpleasant, inattentive, and often just downright rude. The service is extremely slow and the once amazing vegan food is no longer amazing. The most obvious difference, though, you'll notice as soon as you walk in the door. The diner will be only 3/4 full - the counter completely empty - and yet the wait time will be 45 minutes, even without a full crowd in the waiting area. \\n\\nOn my most recent visit, we waited nearly an hour even though the restaurant was never more than 3/4 full. When we finally got seated, we were walked past the empty counter and past an empty mini-booth (which we were told was \\"reserved\\" when we asked if we could sit in it) down to the back to one of the tiny tables wedged in between two already seated parties. \\n\\nThen we waited... And waited... And finally ordered. Then ate our less than spectacular food but ordered dessert because, let's face it, where else can you find such a large variety of vegan desserts? Then we waited... And waited... Then our waitress dropped off dessert and immediately disappeared before we could even tell her it was the wrong dessert! We were heading to a movie so I didn't make a big fuss.

Saying, \\"Told You So\\" now the meals on you to my friends was admittedly gratifying! Nothing has changed. The fish was so dry; I turned it into fish cakes for the next days' brunch. My friends chicken was so dry (we peeled off the skin & gave it to his dog). The sides at best were OK but right out the door when I opened up the containers (in the car) all the food was tepid, I knew what was in store for us before I got home.\\n\\nThe food isn't fresh, lacks flavor and from my experience (having lived in the South) it's a far far cry from real Southern Soul food.\\n\\nAfter the first two bad experiences a few yrs ago I only went there 4-5 x's for the 'Nilla Puddin' (a Southern dessert of bananas, custard & wafers).

The food did not take long to come out but all the food was served at room temperature, nothing was actually hot.  The salad that came with the meal was so overdressed I found it inedible.  We got a side of onion rings for the table that were pretty good but all the sides that came with the meals were disappointing.  Especially the roasted potatoes, which were soggy, and if they spent any time roasting anywhere there was no evidence of it by the time they got to us.  But the steak tips were tender and tasty.  The chicken and lamb tips were good.  The sausage was delicious.  And the ribs were meaty and yummy and the meat fell right off the bone just as advertised.  And I didn't have one myself, but two people in my group thought the fountain drinks were superior to any they had had before.  You don't get free refills but by the way my friends were raving about them you might not mind paying for another.  The service was okay.  People were friendly enough.  But two people ordered the same meal cooked to different temperatures and the person who brought them to the table had no idea which was which.  And we had only had our food for about half an hour when our waitress came back and asked who wanted boxes.  It felt a little like were we being rushed out the door.

Honestly, we ended up here because we were too late for Franklin's BBQ.  Well, it was meant to be because La Barbecue just became my favorite BBQ joint.  Starting with its low key lot.  Here you'll find smokers outside, plenty of picnic tables and chairs, live music, and free beer on Sunday (leave a tip).  BYOB folks.  You've just been invited to the best outdoor cookout in Austin.  You just have to throw in the pot for food.  It's as divey as it gets, and that's OK by me.  1 Star.\\n\\nService - Lines form around 10:30 or so.  They open at 11 AM but you can call in orders to go.  The line is covered and they work quickly.  As you get closer, someone might pass you a fatty, perfectly seasoned burnt end, which only makes the wait even more enticing.  Gotta big order?  They'll help you out to the car if you need extra hands.  Great food by great people.  1 Star.\\n\\nFood - I'll admit I still have yet to try Franklins.  But as far as brisket and ribs go, I've never had better.  The fatty brisket's seasoned bark melts in your mouth with so much flavor.  Salty, sweet, beef, YUM.  The ribs are the brisket's equal.  You get two separate experiences with the rib:  First the fall off the bone rib meat that is so smoky and succulent.  Then there's the top of the rib where you'll find cartilage and fat that's so so meaty it's like eating a pork brisket.  The sausage had great texture and was heavy on pepper.  While we liked it least, it was still better than most BBQ sausages I've eaten.   No review on sides.  Sorry I was a carnivore today.  2 Stars.\\n\\nWill I Return? - YES!

No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star.

And yes it is caf√© style, meaning you won't find a full lunch or dinner menu here, but if you feel like stopping by for tea and a small snack then this is the perfect place!\\n\\nI loved the whole atmosphere - once you walk in there are multiple places to settle in: Japanese style cushions on the 'floor' (it's elevated, but you do need to remove your shoes) or traditional chairs and tables or a higher bar area. There are multiple outlets available so if you stopped by to study or hang out for a while you can do that as well.\\n\\nThey bring the food and drinks to you (with the exception of pastries), but the service was super friendly and quick so that wasn't as much of an issue as I was anticipating based on previous reviews.\\n\\nAnother thing about the service: they are so nice! My friend and I got there (as well as some other people) as they were closing, around 8:45, but we didn't realize and ordered drinks and pastries. We were able to sit down and enjoy our snacks until they politely asked us to leave around 9:30. In the future I'll make my order to-go if I end up there around the same time, but I do appreciate that there wasn't a big fuss about a small wave of people coming in so close to closing - I can't say the same thing for some other businesses in that area.\\n\\nOverall, I had a great experience here and I will definitely be stopping by again in the near future!"},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"My first time ordering and it was actually really good!

Not the best in town, but good.  I think their ground beef is a little bit bland and their fried corn tortillas a bit...thick.  This leads to a chewy texture, which, as one can imagine, is not good.  These tacos aren't as good as Angie's, but they're still pretty unique and worth trying again in hopes of a better experience.  Their prices are not cheap, but very reasonable for the portions.  Minus a star for stale corn chips, under-seasoned beef, and chewy tortillas, though.

Tea Haus is neither because it's both, and it combines and modern and old-fashion look very very well.\\n\\nThe first thing you notice walking in is the interior lined with the juxtaposition of brick walls and walls with a black and red color scheme.  The dim lighting and steady music help you leave your problems at the door and make you forget you're actually in a cafe within a Walmart complex.  The environment they present is just downright cool and no matter how many times you walk in, the feeling that comes to mind is \\"excitement\\".\\n\\nTea Haus has the ambience to hook you in, and their food is right on point with a short, but effective menu.  My order of the day was the Boba Milk Tea and Basil Fried Chicken.\\n\\nWhile I'm not entirely fond of tea in general and this is my first non-flavored milk tea, this deliciousness in a plastic cup took me by surprise.  Not only did I absolutely enjoy every sip, I could see myself getting this again and again.  I ordered my tea half-sweet and this is definitely sweet enough.  The milk tea came at slightly below room temperature, and the ice cooled it down as I drank it.  The flavor of tea is evident and different than the milk teas from other cafes.  The pearls themselves have the right consistency and sweetness and is a tasty snack all on its own.\\n\\nAfter nearly a 10 minute wait, the Basil Fried Chicken came out steaming hot.  Really, don't burn yourself as I did.  This is NOT another imitation of popcorn chicken.  The use of well seasoned super tender dark meat was genius and it was clearly the star of the meal, with the fried exterior merely as a supplement.  The fried batter is coated with the right proportions of seasoning, giving it a powerful flavor without overpowering the chicken or it being too salty.  Two people can and should share one order.  If the milk tea doesn't take your mind off of your troubles, the chicken will.\\n\\nThe service is exceptional as well.  I didn't catch his name, but the guy who took our order was really nice and took the time to make sure our experience was perfect (it was).

If you want their pizza, and you want it delivered, it's perfect. Yes, there is better pizza, but Domino's is an icon and a welcome addition to Plain City. \\n\\nOur pizza arrived hot and on-time. It was made the way we asked, hand tossed, traditional red sauce with mozzarella and pepperoni, one half green pepper, onion and pineapple. The crust was browned perfectly.  It had the right \\"bite\\" and was slightly chewy around the edges.  They cut the slices all the way through so we didn't have to fight to get a slice. The cheese was melted and held the toppings in place. The box was not smashed; no cheese on the lid.  It was just what we wanted and expected (see the picture).\\n\\nThe delivery guy was courteous and friendly. There is a small delivery fee rolled into the cost, but I don't mind paying a delivery fee and a tip, especially when everything is done right.\\n\\nI ordered through the iPhone app, got notifications (even on my watch) as the order was received, entered the oven, headed out for delivery, and then a knock on the door when it arrived hot and fresh. No big deal, you say.  But until this location opened, I couldn't get Domino's delivered in Plain City or New California.  We could get carry out and bring it home to reheat, but that's not the same.  The location is excellent, at the corner of Main Street and Route 42, so if you miss the nostalgia of picking up pizza to bring home, you can do that without having to drive as far.\\n\\nDon't like Domino's pizza?  Well there's a reason the name is just *Domino's* now.  They make more than just pizza. We've had their pasta, wings, boneless chicken, baked sandwiches, cheesy bread, and marble cookie brownies.

They offered us a waiting area to grab a drink and they set up some plates and napkins on the outside railing with standing room and gave us some drink menus. Great Idea! What an awesome way to not have people waiting and crowding the small entry area.\\n\\nThe issue here was in the execution...there wasn't a dedicated server to help people who were supposed to grab a drink while waiting for a table, and obviously everyone was super busy.

First, the sign outside says 1/2 off sushi, sashimi, Maki and rolls. So one would assume they have sushi and/or sashimi. They don't. Just sushi rolls. Just 4 rolls. No sashimi or maki. Second, the waiter explained at great length all of their specials and top of the line items. It was a bit much but was obvious that this is the way he was trained by management and not his fault. We just wanted the sushi. Third, when our bill came the 1/2 off wasn't on it but when we asked our waiter to correct that, he did.

Tanuki takes the idea and throws out all the good, amplifies all the bad.\\n\\nAtmosphere - It's a small place with one server, a TV, four tables and bar seating. Cozy, nothing spectacular, minimal decoration.\\n\\nFood -  Mediocre at best. As others have pointed out it does not really embrace much about Japanese food other than in name. If you want some cheap snacks with a beer, and aren't actually expecting to eat anything, dive in, it's not too hard on the wallet, but light on the stomach as well.\\n\\nService - Nothing exceptional. One waitress for the entire place. My friend had to wait for the waitress to pass by three times to get service, then she tried to sell him a second bottle of sake when he asked for a cup; bit pushy on selling him more drink.\\n\\nNot for large groups (by large I mean more than two people). Menu clearly states they add gratuity tax for groups of five or more, but if you show up with five people they won't seat you.

Great, warm atmosphere. The decor was pleasing to the eye, and the lighting gave the place a intimate yet fun environment-- meaning it's great for dates or for groups. Our waiter was personable. He was kind, patient, and gave us a lot of good recommendations on what to order. (I don't think you can really go wrong with what you order.) \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I ended up getting the bone marrow, oyster boudin fritters, beef cheeks, fried brussel sprouts, and the chili rubbed tuna. \\n- The bone marrow was salty, creamy, and savory. The bread served with it had just the right amount of crunch, and the herb salad paired with it really did cut through the creaminess of the marrow, drawing out more flavors. \\n- The oysters fritters were good, but not memorable. Definitely got the \\"gamey-ness\\" you would expect from boudin, and the oysters tasted fresh. They were fried to perfection, and the chipotle remoulade added the perfect amount of creaminess and (slight) heat. Instead of this, I probably would've opted to try the duck fries or the charcuterie board. \\n- Brussel sprouts--excellent. Fried well and salty. The raisins added the sweetness to balance things out. \\n- The beef cheeks were good, but they really tasted like a Filipino dish my mom makes. The biggest draw was the tenderness of the meat. They braise it in some way, so it fell apart when we were trying to pick it up with our forks. The gravy is really just an extension of the beef--salty and so rich in beef flavor. It was nice to have the mashed potatos that came along with that dish as well. \\n- The chili rubbed tuna was delicious. Really fresh, sushi grade tuna. The chili actually didn't add too much (was expecting a much stronger spiciness), but they seared the tuna well. The tomatoes were crisp and sweet. \\n\\nAll in all, I loved the food because all of the flavors and textures were thought out really well. Everything in each dish paired together nicely, as you probably noticed with my play by play of each dish. Collectively, this made for a great dining experience. The local ingredients must make some kind of difference as well-- I feel like this is what food is supposed to taste like.\\n\\nOther positives: they take reservations, easy to find, and there's a lot of parking! \\n\\nI'll be back, Barl--er, I mean, Salty Sow."},{"name":"Mudflats Bar and Grill","address":"31 Columbus St","city":"Galena","stars":"4","text":"This is an experiance....food is average and service is okay...I had the fish and it was above average...beer is cold and atmosphere is different...do not dress up.... you are going to a bar with food"},{"name":"Beijing Kabobs","address":"5090 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 103","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"the food is very authentic and exotic .

I was starving when I came here, since it had been at least 5 hours since I'd eaten lunch, and I hadn't eaten much for lunch or breakfast.  I came here because (1) it was reasonably close to my hotel; (2) I'd heard about it from other conference-goers; and (3) it was the closest chicken and waffle place that had decent reviews.  Having tried chicken and waffles once before in PGH, I wanted to taste them in their native environs of the South.\\n\\nGiven that I was alone, starving, and not far from my hotel, I decided to opt for take out, esp. when I saw that there were quite a few people waiting to be seated.  I ordered the midnight train, fried green tomatoes, sweet tea, and the sweet potato cheesecake, all of which came to about $30 w/ tax.  The chicken and waffles were very filling; they came with 4 chicken wings and 2 packs of syrup, both of which I used.  The wings were a bit tough, and the waffle was a bit thin and soft.  While they made for a nice flavor and texture combination together, they weren't nearly as good as the ones I've had in PGH (if any of you denizens of the ATL are ever in town, head over to the brunch at Meat and Potatoes to get your chix & waffle fix on).  The fried green tomatoes were decent at first, but they became a bit soggy after I'd eaten a few, which was disappointing.  The sweet tea was excellent--nice and sweet, and the sweet potato cheesecake was pretty good.  Overall, these foods made for a very filling Southern dinner after a long day of conferencing.  Definitely worth trying, although be aware of the wait and the surrounding neighborhood.  3.5 stars.\\n\\nVisitors: Beware of the neighborhood around here--it gets sketchy fast once you cross the interstate.  Although this place was only 3 blocks from my hotel, it was the most unnerving three blocks I'd walked in a long time.

So awesome in fact that I had the opportunity to attend the pre opening here. Since then it's gone downhill. \\n\\nNow that the weather has gotten so summery we like to go get drinks in the seaport. Frozen drinks really work after a day at the beach. As a result I've probably been to this Rosa Mexicano most weekends for the last two months. Every time there is a different bartender working.  They aren't ever super busy working, but between texting and gossiping their shifts must fly by.

Excitedly I would ask friends, \\"Hey guys have you eaten at Your Mama's?\\" only to be greeted by blank stares.  One friend faithfully kept correcting me, \\"You mean-- Your MOM's?\\".\\n\\nYour Mom's is owned and operated by a guy named Ryan.  And what a nice guy is he.  As I was driving down the Chavez I couldn't figure out which road they were off of.  I called and the owner answered.  He helpfully gave me directions and even had his own mom to go outside and flag me down so I wouldn't miss it.\\n\\nUpon sitting down at my picnic bench to peruse the menu I was greeted by the same Mom who was sent outside just a moment before and who happened to be the waitress on duty.  She was sooo nice! She asked if I had been there before (awkwardly, at this point I think you could tell I had not) and she took the time to explain each item on the menu to me.  Now for the break-down:\\n\\nThe items on the menu are named after famous Americana pop stars, such as the Norma Jean or the Snoop Dog.  The hamburgers here are unique because Ryan cooks the cheese in the middle of the patty.  As a result there is a note on the menu that all burgers are cooked Medium Well.  I was concerned about this as I like my meat Medium Rare.  Mom explained to me that more rare would make it hard to melt the cheese.  In the end I let them cook it their way (Med Well) and was pleased with the result.  The burgers are not too greasy, not too salty (THANK YOU), not too dry (even with the med well) and have lots of flavor.  They only buy quality Angus meat that is free of hormones, ect.\\n\\nEverything on their menu is homemade.  This means nothing comes out of a frozen food bag.  The french fries were amazing as they are hand-cut and beer battered.  \\n\\nThey have WiFi, are BYOB, and have outdoor seating.  Most importantly they are family owned, local, have GREAT quality food and really care about you (bonus kudos for that alone!).

The service was very friendly, but surprisingly slow for a weekday night - the food didn't take too long once we ordered, but getting to that point took quite a while, maybe 20 minutes or more. The area we were seated in didn't look very crowded, but maybe there were a lot of people in the other dining room (there's an upstairs and a downstairs). \\n\\nMy fiance and I both ended up ordering fettuccine alfredo, and it was okay at best. The portions were huge, but the sauce was very bland and grainy. It seemed like instead of parmesan, it was made with riccotta, which was odd, to say the least. I make a scratch alfredo sauce at home on occasion, and as smug as it might sound, we both agreed that mine is far and away the better sauce, and I wouldn't consider myself an expert chef by any means. Needless to say, spending $34 before tip between the two of us stung a bit, considering we could've prepared a tastier dish at home for way less money.\\n\\nThat said, most people seemed satisfied with their food, besides a friend who ordered pasta with garlic sauce found her meal swimming in oil.\\n\\nI really liked the atmosphere and the staff, but the food was nothing to write home about, especially for the price.\\n\\nAlso if you're someone who likes to share at restaurants, please note that there's a one dish per head requirement (the menu says that there's a $7.50 charge for each dish under the minimum)."},{"name":"Life Cafe","address":"215 W Central St","city":"Natick","stars":"3","text":"Great place for breakfast and healthy smoothie!\\nI always order Mediterranean omelette and a green smoothie special - I've had it 10 times already and still don't know the ingredients. \\nService is fast and friendly.

Pros include excellent selection of dishes overall, with the option of gluten-free pasta made by the restaurant itself, plus outstanding service for to-go orders, and overall, pretty much everything they make comes in gigantic portions and tastes great. Try the Foundation appetizer, which is buffalo sauce-coated calamari, it's awesome. Also, they make what I believe to be the best Caesar salad in the entire city of Boston, and I'm not normally a big salad guy. The dressing is clearly housemade, and you can taste the quality. The owner and staff are very friendly, and the restaurant itself is cozy without being cramped. This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in all of North End.\\n\\nThere are two negatives though. First, while dining-in service is good during non-peak times, the restaurant always seems understaffed when the restaurant gets very busy. You can easily go 30 minutes without ever seeing a server walk by close enough to draw his/her attention to an issue (and yes, I've actually timed the gaps in service). I believe that the root of the problem is the fact that it's a 2-story restaurant, and their servers are asked to serve tables on different floors, which naturally makes it hard for them to do regular \\"patrols\\" of all of their assigned tables. They can end up spending 20+ minutes on each floor at a time, so unless you get up from your table and go to the other floor to track your server down, you're stuck waiting awhile for a refill or to order more food. Secondly, their chicken parmigana is weirdly terrible. I say \\"weirdly terrible\\" because it's odd for an excellent Italian restaurant to do so well with more creative and labor intensive dishes but then screw up chicken parm, but I've gotten chicken parm from this restaurant twice, and both times, the sauce was bland and watery, and the chicken was flavorless when not coated with aforementioned bland sauce. However, having tried a half dozen other dishes from this restaurant, I can say that the chicken parm is an anomaly, and not a reflection on the quality of cooking overall. \\n\\nLastly, it's worth noting that the wait can be over 1.5 hours during peak times such as Friday night. I don't penalize restaurants for being super popular, I only include that information as a warning that this isn't a great restaurant to plan on \\"wandering\\" into during weekend nights unless you're willing to wait a long time."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Probably the best meal my bf and I had on our vacation to Austin.

I also highly recommend the fried pickles. \\n\\nLastly, since I obviously needed a glass on wine to calm my nerves on what could have been a disaster I would have to say that the selection was quite good for being a hops n' scotch kind of place. The group enjoyed the beer selection, trying everything from coffee beers to Bourbon beers, to tasting local beers.  \\n\\nI just have to say thank you to the managerial staff, kitchen staff and waitstaff for being so flexible and accommodating.

I would even go so far as to stand outside this place and pay people to not go in here. THAT is how much I hate Mamma Maria. We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here a few weeks ago and they totally screwed us over, in more ways than I can count. \\n\\n- They charged a full rate of $75 per person, for kids. Kids that did not eat the appetizers, the salads, the entrees offered, or the dessert. Basically, the kids (well, the ones that stayed awake long enough to eat) each ate a small plate of pasta. For $75. Given the fact that we had 30 adults eating the full priced meals and drinking a lot of wine, you think they would have given us a bit of a break on the kids. Nope.\\n \\n- Their function menu includes 4 courses (apps, salad, entree, dessert). We started at 7pm. We did not leave there until after 11pm. It took them over 4 hours to serve us. That is absurd. As a result, several people had to leave early to take their kids home (they were falling asleep at the table) or relieve their babysitters. Those folks never even got to eat their dinner (although we were charged for it).\\n\\n- Do you know what happens when you have close to 40 people sitting around waiting, waiting, waiting for food? I'll tell you what. The staff just keeps pouring more and more wine. In fact, they apparently poured so much wine that they ran out of the initial red that we ordered and replaced it with $150 bottles of wine (without confirming it with the host of the party).\\n\\nWhen all was said and done Mamma Maria billed us 30 bottles of wine (we only had 23 wine drinkers!). We seriously doubt that each wine drinker had more than a bottle of wine each. But, we were there for 4 hours thanks to how painfully slow their service was, so who really knows?  We were so surprised by that number that we politely asked to see the empty bottles, but they refused. After a bit of questioning on our part, they did agree to take 5 of the $150 bottles off the bill. How big of them. \\n\\nKeep in mind, they automatically got 20% gratuity on the cost of every bottle of wine they poured. Even all of those glasses that were nearly full when we left that night. Gone to waist because after 4 hours of sitting, many people were just too tired to drink anymore or even eat dessert.  \\n\\nAnd speaking of dessert, the one thing we coordinated well in advance was that there would be at least one chocolate option on the dessert sampler. Out of 4 items on the sampler that night, not one of them was chocolate. \\n\\nThe service was flat out terrible and in some instances, rude. I asked the servers to please ask the kitchen to speed things up and I explained that it was getting late and we had kids there and that we had a big day the next day. This was after hours had passed and still no entrees had arrived. Do you know what he said to me? \\"We have a whole restaurant full of customers downstairs that we have to take care of.\\" That may have been true, but who says that? More importantly, who says that to you when you're paying them close to $200 per person in your party!"},{"name":"Black Point","address":"570 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Had dinner here Saturday. 5pmMarch 30 with party of 6.  3 of us arrived early & the waiter was as dry as paper.

It is located on a stretch of road that includes both new developments and older buildings that seem better suited to a one horse town than to Orlando (where we proudly proclaim ownership of two horses and a donkey!).  In such a location, it is out of the way and unlikely to be noticed unless you have business in the area.  I am pleased that I found it and I am sure I shall visit it again.  That said, my visit to Thai Chai #2 was only very good, and I would like it to be great.\\n\\nMy companion and I entered the restaurant shortly after it opened.  The room is large, with what appeared to be about 25 tables, none of which were occupied.  Given the early hour, I was not surprised that the tables were empty.  I was surprised, however, that there was no sign of any of the restaurant's employees, none of whom appeared for about 45 seconds after we entered.\\n\\nAfter we were seated, my companion and I chatted for about 30 minutes before we were ready to order.  During that time, our server did an excellent job of keeping my glass of unsweetened iced tea consistently filled.  When once I was inadvertently given sweet tea, the server was quick to remedy the error.\\n\\nMy companion, who had visited the restaurant before, ordered a Thai fried rice with chicken and pork.  I ordered a vegetarian red curry with tofu.  Both of us asked that our dishes be delivered \\"Thai hot\\" which is about as spicy as any dish can be ordered.\\n\\nI was pleased when shortly after we ordered, our server appeared with a small salad and vegetarian spring roll plate for both my companion and me.  Apparently, the lunch menu includes the salad/spring roll appetizer as part of the fixed price.  Given that our entrees were only $7.95 each, I was very pleased with the addition of an unexpected appetizer (although after lunch, I reluctantly admitted that my trousers were getting a bit snug and that I should probably forego appetizers for a few weeks!).\\n\\nOur entrees arrived soon after we had finished our appetizers.  My friends fried rice plate was well balanced with plenty of chicken and pork to accompany his rice.  I did not notice a lot of vegetables in the dish but I confess that I did not look too closely because my meal was asthetically beautiful and held my attention.  My curry was presented on two serving containers.  Our server placed a plate of white rice in front of me and, off to the side, a bowl fully of radiantly colored fresh vegetables and tofu bathed in a thick curry sauce.  It was one of the more beautiful bowls of curried vegetables and tofu that I have ever seen and one that was \\"magazine-cover\\" worthy.\\n\\nAs I have mentioned, the vegetables were crisp, fresh and flavorful, neither over-cooked nor undercooked.  The curry sauce was spicy, but not as hot as I would have liked.  That may be because many Thai restaurants seem to assume that Westerners cannot handle \\"Thai Hot\\" dishes.  I can handle the heat and if my sinuses are not completely cleared by the time I finish a Thai curry, I feel that I have been incompletely satisfied.\\n\\nThe lack of heat was not the reason that I am withholding a star from Chai Thai #2, however.  Rather it was because the curry sauce did not seem to have any flavor when one got past the heat of the spices.  I look for a lot of levels of flavor in my curries and this one, although it was tasty, still lacked a developed use of the spice rack.  It was good but it did not make me rush home to tell my wife that we had to rush back for dinner.\\n\\nIt is interesting, at least to me, that when I left Thai Chai #2, I was convinced that I would give it a 3 star review.  It's been about 4 hours since I ate and I must acknowledge that my palate has a lingering sense of pleasure associated with my lunch and I am not really sure why that should be.  All I know is that with the passage of time, my memory of the meal is improving.  Thus what would have been a 3 star review at lunch, is now a 4 star review at the end of the day.  (Wouldn't it be nice if Yelp would give us half stars!)\\n\\nIf you are a tourist, you have no real reason to travel down to Orange Avenue but if you are a local, check out Chai Thai Cuisine when you are driving down Orange Ave. Your palate will be happy if you do."},{"name":"Feng Shui","address":"380 Chief Justice Cushing Hwy","city":"Cohasset","stars":"2.5","text":"This Restaurant Is The Best Chinese On The South Shore!!!!

Our waiter didn't even come around for 15 minutes, but I informed him of the cold. Once again, the solution for them was to go heat it up. I informed him it took us this long to get our food, and there is no reason we should wait again for them to put it in the microwave. Then, who I assume was the manager, came over and offered apologies and to take it back. Seriously, we said no. It cost enough, we shouldn't have to do this. I mentioned that even the potatoes which they probably make in bulk were cold, and he asked if he could bring me more. They weren't even that good, so no.

The cashew nut dish is excellent - like the variations I've had at every other Thai restaurant, it is a little low on the cashews (but hey, I get it, cashews are expensive), but the flavor is great, with just the tinge of spiciness to keep it interesting. Great Thai Ice Tea as well, although I usually like to opt for the lychee juice. Last time I was there they had banana sticky rice as a special which was just so damn good.

Walking past it you could not help but touch it.  The restaurant holds about 70 people in cozy, contemporary surroundings.  Floor to ceiling wine racks break up some of the seating, which adds a nice touch to this inviting restaurant and of course screams \\"wine bar.\\"  The bar is surrounded by about 12 high chairs that look towards a huge wall of wines.  Wine everywhere, my kind of place. \\n\\nMy friend arrived and it was time to look at the wine list.   A loose-leaf book with about 30 pages of wines.  For the large selection of wines by the glass they offer 100ml tasting size, a 250ml carafe and a 500ml carafe.  They are a bit pricey at an average of $9 just for a tasting size, but I love the idea of being able to try small amounts of different wines.  I ordered a 100ml taste of the Erbaluce, Ferrando 'La Torrazza', Caluso, IT '08.  Spot on first time - I loved this wine.  Fresh, crisp, a hint of citrus, delicious.  I did plan on trying a couple of different wines but ended up sticking with the Erbaluce throughout the night.  My friend on the other hand had a number of sips of different red wines until she found one to her liking.   The waitstaff seemed very happy to oblige her in this (free) tasting.  It was nice that they were as keen on her satisfaction as she was.  She ultimately settled on the Malbec, Clos La Coutale, Cahors, FR '08.  \\n\\nBin 26 is currently celebrating its fifth anniversary so they had a number of first course dishes that were $5 each.  We decided on the Saffron Risotto Balls and Whipped Ricotta Peppers Agro Dolce & Pancetta Bruschetta.\\n\\nThe Saffron Balls looked perfect in presentation.  A lovely light golden color and soft to cut into but sadly they were just nice, not spectacular at all. They were really just cheesy rice lightly fried but with not much saffron flavor, if any.  I think a little more saffron and definitely some seasoning would have made these really good and not just okay. \\n\\nThe Bruschetta was fresh and tasty with small strips of pancetta that added a subtle salty taste to the creamy flavor of the ricotta atop crispy toasted French bread. I might have to replicate this dish at home. \\n \\nIn between ordering our first course and thinking about the second, our waiter at the start of the evening seemed to just disappear and we were left not having any idea who to ask for service.  I called over the host, we talked to the barman, we asked another waiter - it was all very odd.  Finally, someone came to serve us so we asked what happened.  She just said \\"oh yeah, he finished his shift.\\"  It didn't spoil our evening but we thought that it would have been nice to know as we had been talking about the wine and menu options with the waiter that left. Our second waiter was very attentive and service oriented so it did make up for our initial waiter disappearance.  \\n\\nFor our entrees we both settled on menu description appealing pasta dishes.  After chatting with the waiter and inevitably telling her to make the decision for me, I (she) opted for the Cocoa Tagliatelle with Porcini Mushroom Ragu scented with Nepitella and My friend picked the Pappardelle with Pork Ragu, Peas and Ricotta Cheese.\\nMy dish had an amazing aroma.  It was hard not to just dig in like an old Italian fisherman starved after a week at sea and wolf it down.  The taste was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  I was a little skeptical of the cocoa pasta but it worked quite well and gave a mild bitter taste to the perfectly cooked tagliatelle.  The mushroom Ragu was lovely and not to heavy.  All in all, I was very happy with my choice.  My friend enjoyed her dish and said it was lovely but she is going to order what I had next time.  \\n\\nAs we dined the restaurant had slowly filled up with lots of walk-ins off Charles Street, which added a hum of chatter to this quiet Monday evening.  We felt comfortable raising our voices, laughing with the waitstaff and generally enjoying our impromptu evening.\\n\\nOur evening ended but not before we spent about five minutes touching the cork wall coat hanger.  You have to see it; it has a very touchable appeal to it.  It is like one of those paintings at a gallery that says \\"do not touch\\" but you are allowed to touch the cork wall coat hanger so you must.   \\n\\nBin 26 is lovely for a date night, a semi-private group dinner in the back or just to sit at the bar and try a few different wines while enjoying some small bites."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I visited Tilt last week on Sunday afternoon June 23.

However, late night truffle fries were fresh, crispy and exactly what you need after a drink or two (or four).\\n\\nDrinks: tasty, balanced cocktails (though maybe not the most inventive) and an excellent selection of beers on draft.

I've gotten borderline over attentive servers as well as uninterested bartenders that couldn't be bothered to take an order despite being well under capacity.\\n\\nAmbience/layout: They hit upscale neighborhood bar for sure, with some questionable uses of space. The booth under the stairs and the long island along the bar need to go.

I'm a big fan of the neighborhood, Portland's Alphabet district and got distracted and delayed by the many alfresco dining opportunities and cocktail bars in the area.  Stay focused, we're here for barbecue.  Next time though, I have got to find to find some lodging nearby.\\n\\nBut I digress.  Barbecue.  That means smoked brisket and pork ribs to me, beef ribs if I'm lucky.  You'll usually find some pulled pork and a sausage at most barbecue joints and it's often pretty standard stuff.  The menu at Smokehouse 21 was interesting, offering pork cheeks and burnt ends.  Sadly, they were out of the burnt ends this time, but I'll try again.\\n\\nThe deviled egg with a hunk of smoked sausage is a fine way to start, and goes well with a cold IPA.  Pork cheeks were a new addition to my barbecue experience.  I've had them braised, and served over pasta or polenta, but never smoked for barbecue as in this preparation. These oval, golf ball sized orbs of barbecued pig face picked up a lot of smoke and flavor in the cooking process, but also lost a bit of moisture, becoming slightly dry.  The quality of the meat was great, very tender, properly seasoned and smoked, but it's also a pretty small cut, so can lose some moisture during long slow cooking. \\n\\nPork ribs were a treat. These particular specimens were extra thick and juicy, with a rich smoky flavor.  Again the quality of the meat was excellent as these had a good amount of marbling which kept them juicy and flavorful.  Delicious.  Brisket, sad to say was a little dried out.  It was very tender and smoky, from long slow smoking, but like the cheeks it lost a lot of moisture between cooking and serving.  I'm not one for sauce, preferring the meat to stand alone.  Maybe the sauce would help, but it shouldn't have to.   \\n\\nOne thing they do at Smokehouse 21 is serve the meats with a sprinkling of finishing salt.  I'm accustomed to seasoning in the rub, or adding salt and pepper before the meat is smoked, but not for finishing.  It does add some flavor and interest, along with a toothsome crunch in that first bite or two, but after a few bites I had to brush it all off because it got to be just too salty, and took away from the flavor of the meat.  With the brisket being a little on the dry side, the finishing salt didn't help.   \\n\\nA side of mac and cheese, blue cheese that is, was outstanding and the collard greens were delicious.  Served in large pieces these greens have been slow cooked in a sweet vinegary pot liquor with some shredded pork achieving a tender smoky flavor.  You'll eat these veggies.  \\n\\nService was good, friendly and attentive.  This is a small space, but there are a few tables outside.  Cool vibe, good food, great neighborhood, Smokehouse 21 is definitely worth checking out.  Hope they have some burnt ends for me next time."},{"name":"Aroa Fine Chocolate","address":"1651 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"beautiful macaron. no need to say more.\\n\\nokay, an array of beatiful macaron flavors. incredible.\\n\\nI don't think I have even tried anything else here. even when I got for hot cocoa, I get side-tracked by macaron. they are amazing. and a petit price as compared with the lovely ones sold at formaggio. hence, these are my favorite little treat to bring to meetings and dinner parties."},{"name":"Dragon City","address":"2200 Winter Springs Blvd, Ste 115","city":"Oviedo","stars":"3.5","text":"Dragon City is in the same location as Dragon Court, but with new owner.

The food quality was absolutely outstanding. First, my dirty gin martini was large and well made, and absolutely worth its $12 price tag-- easily the size of two cocktails elsewhere. They served us fresh baked rolls for the breadservice and though the butter was ice cold, it spread evenly and lovely across the perfectly crusty brioche. I had the potato dumplings in gorgonzola cream for an appetizer and they were heavenly, if a bit under seasoned. My entree was the pork cooked with apples and I truly consider it a flawless dish. Every component was well cooked and the pork was juicy and tender. I was, sadly, disappointed by dessert which was pedestrian by comparison to the rest of the food and the coffee had lots of flecks of bean and was just not filtered well. There were many awkward lulls in service and it took an exorbitant amount of time for us to get our bill. However, for a restaurant week dinner on what was a surprisingly busy time (6:30 on a Monday) the service was adequate if not impressive.

The Scotch Egg with the spicy chorizo was amazing! We loved it and wanted more! The fried Chicken Livers were delicious (a tad little over cooked) but the accompanying bacon dipping sauce soothed and cooled the saltiness a notch. While the salad was typical with a generous portion of big croutons and greens, it was a smidgeon bit salty for our taste.\\n\\nWe had two of their specialty drinks. Their menu is extensive with scotch and other liquors, but I am not an expert and not fan of them. We were recommended the THE CAT LADY (Pama, St Germain and Prosecco) which was served in a champagne glass.  The LOGAN had Beefeaters, Kirsch, Limoncello, and Ruby Red with that combination it was strong but delicous.  The Cat Lady fit the bill for my mom wanting not too strong and sweet. It was balanced and the bubbly kick from the prosecco was great.\\n\\nFor our entrees, the short ribs were out so we had the pork belly. A generous portion of perfectly cooked pork belly served over not overly buttery mashed potatoes and a bit over charred grilled cob of corn with it. The accompanying sauce was flavorful and accented the pork belly. The risotto was not  bad with fresh peas and green beans while not being over cheesy and it had the right amount of creaminess topped with crispy onion which was a nice touch. Then one of us got the HOPS BURGER which was on a lovely buttered and toasted Brioche Bun, hand cut fries (great with their housemade ketchup) and cheese.

The crust is doughy and fresh, but had enough flavor to keep it interesting. I like the old-school sauce, very simple and minimal.

Apparently their standard is medium well unless otherwise requested. Somehow, though, the kitchen forgot to put on the honey mayo that was supposed to be on the burger.

There are a lot of options in Austin, and I can't think of a reason to choose this one."},{"name":"Abby Lane","address":"255 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Well first of all, if you're planning to eat here before the theater, you may need to call more than a day ahead for a reservation. What it has going for it, basically, is just that: a place close to the show. We booked several days ahead, requesting a table by a window upstairs. We actually arrived early.  With very little acknowledgement, we were led to a downstairs table in the middle of the room. We asked for upstairs and were told there was no room upstairs. To be honest, we were dubious, but took the table we were offered. The best part of the evening was Lauren, our server, who was friendly, helpful and attentive, although she did say things were 'great' that turned out not to be. We ordered drinks - Abby Lane does tend to do well with drinks - and Buffalo wings.  Not sure how they can call them Buffalo wings.  It was five and half (yes, a half) pieces of wing parts, served with a smattering of sliced radishes and greens and with ranch dressing instead of blue cheese. The wings were okay, but not at all spicy. So really none of the things that make Buffalo wings Buffalo Wings.\\n We ordered the french onion soup - which Lauren accurately described  and which you wouldn't call 'traditional' in any sense - and the falafal and chicken burger, both of which Lauren inaccurately described as 'really good.'  The falafal was gummy and the chicken burger was dry, even with the mozzarella which was cold, and extra basil mayonnaise. We left most of both dishes untouched. The one good thing were the eggplant fries I got as a side. Cooked just right, they came with a meh sauce, but I dipped them in extra basil mayo.\\nOn the plus side, service was fast - actually almost too fast, we kind of felt like we were being rushed. And they were happy to bring extra sauce quickly.\\nWe have been here before - due to it's convenience - and noted that there were a number of things missing from the menu that we had liked, such as the calamari appetizer and Cubano sandwich. We asked if there was a different menu upstairs and were assured it was the same. So it seems like there have been some cutbacks on choices but it has not improved the food.\\nWe very well may return due to the convenience, but we will call again day of to try to get upstairs - which is more pleasant - even if we have to sit on a sofa and eat our 'french' onion soup off a coffee table."},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Great food and great service.

I'd hate to drive 30 minutes for a Chicken Khorma craving)...\\n\\nAtmosphere: yes, it is empty- at times awkward and quiet with just you and another table across the way. yes, the cute little server doesn't really speak english- but he makes up for any misunderstanding with his apologetic smile. yes, the staff could be a little friendlier (I miss the older man in his 70's from a couple years back- I used to go JUST for him. He was the host, the server, the busboy, and probably the chef- that part I could never confirm ha). But know it's a generally younger \\"staff\\" of 30- year old men who some Yelpers have properly identified as \\"lacking smiles\\" or any enthusiasm for having a diner. (You'd think as sparse as dinner is on that particular night they'd be thrilled to make some money when you walk in!) \\n\\nThe server's are very short and concise. Don't go if it's your first time experiencing Indian food. Go if you KNOW what you want, and order it without looking at the menu or hesitating. I personally only get Chicken Khorma at any Indian Restaurant we go to because I don't like spicy foods. My husband gets Lamb Tikka Masala VERY HOT and loves it. \\n\\nSpiciness:\\nMy entire family was raised in England around authentic Indian restaurants. They like their Indian HOT- I missed this tastebud and think ketchup is hot. I love knowing where we can go to a restaurant and I can order the mild khorma and not be miserable my entire meal, while my dad, husband, and grandfather can order the \\"VERY VERY HOT\\" and be shedding tears of misery from the spice the whole time. By the time the meal is over, everyone at my table is blowing their noses and looking for dairy to quench the small fire in their mouths. \\n\\nPrice: \\nYES, the food IS pricey. Once you order naan (even with NO DRINKS and just water), a table of 2 is easily $50. It's kind of ridiculous. In a perfect world, naan would be complimentary (like Rumi's Kitchen), or at least $1, not $2.50, because most tables of 4 need 3-4 orders. A meal is around $15 then you factor in tip and tax and if you like some side spices- that's an extra $4.... it just adds up. \\nFor the price I pay at Raja, I usually reserve the $50+ dinners for \\"nicer\\" restaurants. That being said, it is a rarity to eat there because we don't feel like it always adds up to be worth it. It's almost a once-in-a-blue-moon dying for-craving-can't-stop-thinking-about-Indian food, then we suck it up and enjoy a $65 meal on a Tuesday night with our server who disappears the minute our order is placed, and laugh to ourselves at the empty restaurant that's all to ourselves. \\n\\n\\nMy suggestion to Raja: instead of having high prices for the occasional diner, I would strategically make items on the menu way more affordable. I think for the atmosphere and the entire dining experience, a guest would look to spend $30 after tip. Maybe reducing prices would entice more people to try the food and stick with you guys as regulars. I know for a fact if the price reflected the establishment, we would be regulars at a rate of 4-5 times a month. So, doing the math... you would get $120-$150 from us versus the random twice a year craving for $100. Why does it matter? Because when people ask, (and people always do) \\"what's your favorite Indian Restaurant?\\" We wont hesitate sending them to Raja knowing the place is less than thrilling, the servers less than enthusiastic, and the prices less than justifiable. When people ask me about Indian I send them to Decatur and to nicer restaurants that help make a $60 tab less of an ordeal (fancy linens, fancy servers, polite staff, decent food). But for Raja to be the hole-in-the-wall that it is, I think a major menu change needs to be done. I get that they're in Buckhead and rent might be high, but I bet having affordable items that people come back for time and time again woud keep the restaurant full and the prices low."},{"name":"Mamma Maria","address":"3 North Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Very nice place, attentive service and overall good food. They change their menu daily so there is always something different. The reason for 4 and not 5 stars although I would like to give 4.5 if that was an option, is because the menu is limited. The menu is only one page and there is very limited actual pasta dishes for the entrees. I will say tho they are willing to make the appetizer dishes entrees. I personally would of liked more than two entree pasta options. I got the bolagnese pasta which had good flavor with the sauce and meet the noodles I believe are homemade but I wasn't the biggest fan. Another guest got the clam pasta from appetizers as an entree size and enjoyed it, someone else got the osso bucco which was large in size and very tasty. The other guest got the meatball apitizer at regular apitizer size and was informed there were four meatballs. Just be informed they are not the average meatball size they are miniature. I would not recommend even getting them as an appetizer due to small size and definitely not enough to share. Their bread and dipping sauce was amazing and italian olives are given with it.

Then on top of it all when they delivered the food they didn't deliver one persons food.  Ten minutes later they come and tell us they are out of that dish.  WHAT IN THE HELL?!  The food runner/expo person said it wasn't his responsibility.  I asked for the manager and he was and i quote \\"Too busy to come and talk to me, but he was comping my meal what else did I want\\".  Not only to hell with this place but I wouldn't eat there or recommend eating there if it was the last place on earth.\\n\\nI've worked in this industry and I know what it takes.

It's in a tiny, cramped building with very limited parking. This location has been around for many years and they seem to do good business, both delivery and carry-out.\\n\\nI stopped by on a Wednesday evening on my way home from work (a peak period) and the store was expectedly slammed. At one point, there were no available parking spots. Customers and delivery drivers alike were parking in any open space they could find in the driveway, blocking some cars completely in. While a bit chaotic, this really didn't cause too much trouble for anyone since people were constantly coming and going. Just note that parking can be an issue here.\\n\\nI ordered a $7.99 large three-topping pizza. This deal is available Monday-Thursday, carry-out only. It's a great deal considering large pizzas are regularly priced at $10.99 plus $1.69 per topping. Available pizza sizes are small (10\\"), medium (12\\"), large (14\\"), and extra large (16\\"). A large is good for 2-3 people. Another deal they have going is a medium two-topping pan pizza for $7.99. Domino's always seems to be running specials so be sure to check their web site for any discounts you might be able to take advantage of.\\n\\nIn lieu of phoning in, ordering online, or using the Domino's mobile app (which I would have to find and download in the first place) to place my order, I decided to order in-person and wait at the store. Total wait time was about 12-15 minutes. That was reasonable considering how busy they were at the time. The store was well-staffed and everyone was hustling and bustling, taking new orders, making pizzas, and picking up new deliveries.\\n\\nI chose pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom for my toppings. Through the open kitchen, I was able to see the pizza get made from scratch. Domino's advertises some of its pizzas as \\"handmade\\" (e.g. the \\"Handmade Pan Pizza\\"), but all their pizzas are technically handmade. The pizza was tasty. It was relatively less greasy than I remember Domino's Pizza being. The crust was a little salty, but I think I prefer it over the crust of a chain competitor like Papa John's. It's more flavorful. Cheese and toppings were A-OK.\\n\\nLike the other \\"Big Four\\" pizza chains (Little Caesars, Papa John's, Pizza Hut), Domino's continues to stand the test of time. It's the largest pizza chain in the world. I don't eat Domino's often, but I feel like it's improved and better than how I remember it from years ago.

Reserving the hibachi table is a MUST. Our hibachi chef was so much fun and interacted with each person in our party during his cooking. This is basically a show during your dinner! We reserved an entire table (party of 12) for a birthday celebration. (Be sure your entire party is on time though, because they'll make you wait to be seated until everyone shows up - which makes sense! But can be frustrating when you have 1 super late guest).

Fun experience and will be back for another special occasion in the future."},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I finished my third of the four \\"square\\" burgers last night, so far all of them exceeded my expectations. Definitely give them a shot, I fancy the Inman Square burger the most so far. The food is still great, the service friendly, and the general vibe awesome, but I need to knock you down a star Veggie Galaxy. Bear with.\\n\\nI'm sure there is significant effort put into maintaining a cross-contaminant free food-prep area, and the place is spotless. That being said, I noticed two problems with the cookstaff. One line cook had a beverage that they were occasionally drinking between bouts of work. Call me crazy, but nothing should be consumed where the food is being prepared. It was an outside beverage, so every time they touch that cup with their gloved hands, that glove touched the cashiers hands who handed it over, which in turn touched the cash that was handed over for said drink, which was in turn touched by the crack-cocaine snorted on the bills last week on the back of the route 66 bus. Surely that is an exaggeration, but the point remains. Change yo' gloves!\\n\\nSimilarly, another line cook had an issue with his gloved hands. His facial hair must have itched - hey, that happens to me all the time - and he used the back of his gloved hands to settle that irritability. Great! But then he didn't change gloves. Not great! Let's break this down. The line cook was a babe amongst babes - I'm talking babe pig in the city grade-A bacon BABE. I don't mind having part of his face rubbed up against anything that I come in contact with if you catch my drift. But that's just me. I don't mind you scratching your face twice (double the pleasure!) but most people wouldn't view that as a statement of the great mint that is double mint gum. Wholesale food-prep gloves are cheap and plentiful for a reason - change them out after each unsecured contact.\\n\\nLast, the service fell just a touch short too. I ordered a side because it had a silly name and I wanted to see what it looked like. What can I say, I live on the edge and being able to see a \\"tofu egg\\" happened to be on my vegan bucket list. It was bright yellow and clearly colored from from turmeric, and whaddayaknow, I love turmeric! But there was a lot of it, so like a real egg I wanted some ketchup to balance that out. Our server must have disappeared from our space-time continuum after dropping our plates only to reemerge when our bill had been printed. Maybe he used a transwarp conduit and zipped over to planet Turmeric -Prime because they grow higher concentrated turmeric plants (I can't think of any other reason there was too much turmeric in my tofu egg!) but here's a tip, server! Setup an interplexing subspace beacon so you can keep in contact with your tables should they need something so unexpected like, say, ketchup. \\n\\nBut f'realz, this place is still great, and they just need to have some more accessible gloves for the line cooks and servers who remember to check on their tables a bit more often."},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great food and I could see the atmosphere would be awesome on a warmer, less rainy evening.

The combination of my favorite dinner date being in the hospital and me being extremely tired of hospital food (good as it may be) made me do it. It's just not something I do. The last time I did that, it was pre-planned for about a month and it involved me, a book, earbuds, Pandora, and sushi. This time, I thought I'd slip out of the hospital for a bit and pick up some Kung Pao to satisfy my craving. I figured I'd get it to go and go back to my place next to my hubby's sickbed in under half an hour. Well, when I got there (at an odd time for a meal), the place was empty and quiet. I thought it might be nice to eat there and enjoy some peace and quiet and real dishes and silverware instead of a busy hospital and styrofoam box and plastic utensils. One look inside revealed a clean and tidy restaurant that even OCD grandma (God rest her soul) would approve of. The gentleman up front (Bruce?) greeted me with a genuine smile when I walked in and said, \\"Welcome home!\\" like he meant it. He seated me and took my order as soon as I was ready, but, didn't hover. I settled in for a long wait. Since it was before normal dinner time, I didn't think the kitchen would be up and running. Wrong! I had my hot tea almost instantly, egg rolls within 5 minutes, and Kung Pao in under 15 minutes. \\nNow, about the food. Wow! Just....wow! No MSG. Fresh ingredients. No breading (in my dish) obscuring mystery meat. This was real, good, healthy (comparatively speaking) Chinese food! The bell peppers still had a bite to them, the zucchini was just firm enough to be delectable, the water chestnuts were perfectly chopped (instead of canned disks), and the peanuts were delightfully crunchy. In short, I'm hooked. I already ate half of my leftovers for a fourth meal and I'm looking forward to finishing it off for lunch tomorrow....or breakfast (don't judge....or do). The portions were large, but, not obscene. With an order of egg rolls, I'm easily getting three meals out of it (I'd probably only get two out of it if I were really hungry.).\\nI'm already planning to grab some more of China Delight's yummy goodness on our way home from the hospital. It's amazingly good and gives much less guilt than normal American Chinese food. \\nSide note:  their American breakfast menu looks amazing!

The bathroom is upstairs so that might be an issue for the elderly or someone with mobility issues. Our server was friendly and warm. It was a busy evening due to large parties so I understood refilling waters was not a priority.\\n\\nWe ordered the foie gras. Sure it was $25 but it was really creamy and oh so delicious! We even saved some (after our bread crisps ran out) to add on top of our ravioli! \\n\\nWe also ordered the short rib ravioli which was in a cream sauce...it was good. But I would probably try a different dish for next time.\\n\\nFor our mains we had the sable fish special which was delicious. It was flavourful, tender, I enjoyed the dish.\\n\\nI thought I had ordered the rack of lamb which looked amazing in photos and when our dish arrived, our server said I had ordered the lamb shank. There was a communication mix up and I take part responsibility for this error. When ordering I had said \\"we'll have the sable fish and lamb\\" I failed to remember that there was more than 1 lamb on the menu (there was lamb shank and rack of lamb). But I never uttered the word \\"shank\\". I recall the server asking if I wanted the steak or lamb which I thought was weird because I said I wanted lamb (there was also beef steak on the menu) and she never asked me how I wanted my lamb to be cooked (I assumed it would be how the chef would want it prepared...so I didn't think much of it)\\n\\nSo the lamb shank arrived and I was disappointed...I pointed out to our server that I had never said I wanted the lamb shank (I don't order lamb shanks often unless I'm in a Greek restaurant and I'm not a fan of the flavours often associated with Mediterranean type dishes) so I knew right away this entree would not be enjoyed. The server was nice enough to say \\"please try it, if you don't like it I will take it away and will not charge you for it\\".  I did try it (the meat was cooked nicely) but the flavours of the meat and risotto was just not my thing. Unfortunately we did not order the rack of lamb because we were told it would take at least anther 45 minutes, so we ordered the linguine Nero (lobster, striped prawns) which was quite good and took less time to make.\\n\\nThe moral of the story is if you're not sure about something clarify because you can't assume everyone is on the same page. As the server was pleasant and I was equally pleasant, the evening was still enjoyed by myself and my guest. However, having been in the service industry, I think the server should have also clarified whether I wanted the rack of lamb or lamb shank. When I explained to her that I had wanted the rack of lamb my server replied \\"that is a steak cut, when you say lamb that means the shank\\". Ok fair enough. But I'm not a chef and I am pretty sure there's a lot of other people who would not have known that either..so my only issue is that it would have been appreciated if she had acknowledged her error as well (you can't assume people know this).\\n\\nThe dessert was unique to me, the semifreddo (it's like an icecream cake but better). It was our most beautiful dish of the evening and a nice way to end the evening.\\n\\nI will be back for another special occasion and will make sure to order the rack of lamb, and will specify that I want the rack of lamb and not the lamb shank lol."},{"name":"Small Pharoah's","address":"340 SW 5th St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I honestly wasn't that impressed with the food I got here.

I don't blame this experience on her at all, I blame it on the management. \\n\\nYou know what's great about the \\"check in\\" part on the yelp app? It tells you what time you got to the restaurant. I checked in right after we ordered our drinks. This is how our time went: \\n\\n7:45 - Order drinks.\\n\\n8:00 - Order appetizer\\n\\n8:10 - Receive drinks, I got the blood orange margarita, it was separated, that is, it was mostly melted with a little part in the middle still frozen, obviously it had been sitting a while. Also, it was COVERED in salt. I happen to not like salt on my margaritas so this was kind of a downer. My bf ordered a gin and tonic, but the manager brought over a shot of gin? With a glass of half melted ice? He informed her what he actually ordered and off she went. \\n\\n8:20 - He gets his correct drink... our server is no where to be seen. The tonic water was flat. Completely flat, when our server reappeared and we told her this she said, literally, \\"Oh yeah I should have mentioned that. It hasn't been working.\\" \\n\\n8:30 - Receive appetizer, we got the charcuterie plate, we figured it'd be a good introduction to the place. it was really odd, like nothing really went together. We've had a LOT of charcuterie plates in our day, and this was one of the weirdest. It had smoked salmon, I believe it was two slices of capicola, a chicken liver rillette I think, and another type of pate style meat that looked like meatloaf. It wasn't bad, it was just kind of weird. Like the cheese didn't go with the meat or the salmon and... whatever. It was ok. \\nOur server appears to drop off our wine that we ordered to go with the meal that we hadn't even ordered yet, and she tells us she'll be back to tell us the specials in a jiffy.\\n\\n8:45 - We ask for the check and leave. Seriously, an hour? To get drinks and a somewhat average/mediocre appetizer? Are people not hungry when they eat here? Our server was very apologetic, we could see she had way too many tables and we didn't blame her at all. However, management? Where were you? It was pretty obvious this place is still trying to get into a rhythm. We'll probably be back in a few weeks to check it out again, but in the mean time, unless you have a lot of time to kill, I'd stay away."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Was headed to a different restaurant in Boston, after picking up cannolis at Modern pastry in the North End.

I know vegan cheese is very hard to perfect, but this stuff was the nastiest cheese substance I've ever tasted AND it ended up giving me a bigger stomach ache than I've ever received from actual cheese.

They ended the night by bringing out churros with three different dipping sauces (chocolate, caramel, and raspberry? sauce). My god those churros were absolute sin.

I go every week for sake and omakase. Here's the deal:\\n\\nThe interior is a dark, magical place for people who are looking for an intimate, somewhat twisted experience. Twisted? Sure: come for movie night to see Japanese horror gore films, or sex tips from an animated hamster, or Japanese childrens' shows from the 60s.\\n\\nThe food is wonderful, cheap, and ever changing. Japanese / Korean / Philippine mashups abound, built with fresh ingredients, and seasoned by someone who knows how to please an adventurous palette. Omakase is the way to go: pay $25, and the chef will prepare an unending stream of delicious dishes delivered directly to your table. You can eat happily for *hours,* surprised by every plate that arrives, until you wave the white flag of surrender. This is undoubtedly the best deal in town.\\n\\nThe sake -- where to start? This is the best place to drink sake in Portland, hands down. The selection is huge, and they go to great lengths to acquire hard to find and specialty sakes. They don't just have sake, they know sake, and will happily help you find the right drink for whatever you happen to be eating. They also have imported malt liquor and cheap asian lagers. It's all good.\\n\\nThe service is ... special. There is a zero bullshit rule: service is fast, friendly, polite, and knowledgeable ... but if you act like a prima dona and disturb other guests, expect to get the boot. As a frequent guest, I appreciate this rule: I know I'm going to have a good time, and I know I'm going to meet great people. What else could you want from a bar?\\n\\nThis isn't a place for people with delicate sensibilities. You can't bring children. It's loud.

On the 2nd occasion, I bought 6 danishes, and the cashier charged me tax yet again. Also, I bought some pecan pie from here, and they call it \\"pecan ganache\\", but I swear it tastes like the pecan torte from costco, just with some chocolate drizzled on the top. The pecan torte  (10') from costco is $14-15, and the \\"pecan ganache\\" (10') rom this place is $45. I bought the pecan torte from costco once, and on the same day, I purchased a slice of the \\"pecan ganache\\", and it tastes and looks identical to the one from costco.

The bakery was surprisingly bustling with a completely full staff anticipating a busy launch (there were at least 3-4 employees manning the front end, with a half dozen including the owner running the back). Since I knew I'd be back, I picked out a matcha melon pan and melon pan for my fiance, and an pan (red bean filled) for myself. For those of you are unfamiliar with melon pan, there is no melon flavor. It is a bread with a cookie crust on top! The shelves are very clever, there is an acrylic door that you can pull up, and then push back like a garage door. I didn't realize this and was trying to hold it open while holding my tray and gingerly using tongs to pick out bread- now I know. ;) Since I arrived so early I didn't see any baguette type breads out yet. Understandably, even bakeries opened for years will not have all their stock out at opening time. The bread was so fresh they were quite delicate. I used the tongs to gently take them out by holding the sides (don't squeeze from the top and bottom!).  I saw shokupan on their menu (a tender, white dinner bread), and they would have the square style (the ones with the rounded tops are called yama shokupan) out in a few minutes. The store at this point had over 20 people and the line was getting huge, so understandably it took some time for them to get to slicing the shokupan for me (they were setting out unsliced shokupan, for which you can request thin or thick slices. I love thick!). I walked in the door at about 8 am, and left at about 8:20 am and with a very lovely free mug that they gave as a promotion (first 30 customers). \\n\\nEven though the bread was gently placed in individual bags and into my larger bag, they did get *slightly* smooshed. This didn't bother me in the slightest, but might be something to keep in mind. The bread is that lovely and soft!\\n\\nBoth melon pans had an amazing delicate and just crisp surface. It had a lovely sweetness that paired well with the soft bread interior. My an pan was generous with the red bean filling, and again, the quality of the bake was top notch. Lastly, I enjoy eating shokupan by the slice - it is amazingly soft, and despite appearing to be a 'plain white bread' it has quite a nice depth of flavor that's subtle and quite enjoyable. If you gently toast a thick piece of shokupan, it will have a perfect surface crunch to FLUFFY interior. My grandma loves this style of Japanese bread.  I saw that they were bringing out tarts with strawberry and chocolate, but darn was on my way out. \\n\\nFor business updates, you should check their facebook page. I'm not sure what their hours are quite yet, but last I checked they were opening at 8 pm, with the goal of a 7 am opening with 6 am drive through possibility (which would definitely be the hook and sinker for my fiance who has to get to work by 7). \\n\\nThere is plenty of parking, and they have sandwiches for a lunch menu. \\n\\nI guess Oyatsupan is a big deal because from what I know of there are no Japanese bakeries in the Portland metro area. Having grown up near Sawtelle and frequenting Little Tokyo down in Los Angeles, I'd been pretty spoiled. The quality is comparable as well, so to me this is worth getting excited about! For those of you who aren't seeing the big deal or aren't hyped up, Best Baguette has asian baked goods, and Uwajimaya, H Mart or the asian food marts might stock something sort of in the vein, but really, it's comparing apples to oranges. This is baked very fresh.\\n\\nWelcome to Beaverton, Oyatsupan!!

We usually have dinner somewhere nice - Fabi and Rosi, for example - when Pop visits, but I decided to gamble (based on Yelp! reviews) and try out Salty Sow.\\n\\nI'll admit that the name is a bit cheeky (and I admit, made me a bit cautious), but we took the advice of the various Yelp reviews, and gave it a shot.  I love the location - off the \\"beaten path\\" (which means somewhere off 2nd, 5th, or 6th), and pretty close to my place.  There's LOTS of parking, and the neighborhood is older but well kept; it didn't feel like the ghetto at all.\\n\\nThe place wasn't crowded when we arrived but it was by the time we left.  I'm glad I called ahead to make reservations.\\n\\nThe building, as has been noted in other reviews, used to be Red House Pizzeria, but the transition was well done, and both the interior and exterior and cheerful without being tacky.  The interior is homey (and pork-themed), but manages to do it in a manner that carries a classy vibe at the same time.  Mild complaint is that you have to squeeze by waiters and other customers to walk anywhere as aisle space is a bit tight.\\n\\nSeating is comfortable - despite the high benches and chairs, a foot rest bar is provided underneath the table so your legs don't dangle.  We did our meal semi-tapas style, sharing everything with everyone, on the advice of one of the reviewers below.  Here's what we ordered (along with prices, yay copy/paste!)\\n\\nTRIPLE FRIED DUCK FAT FRIES 110 minute egg, cold b√©arnaise 5\\nROASTED BONE MARROW herb salad, walnut oil, toast 10\\nOYSTER BOUDIN FRITTERS chipotle remoulade 8\\n\\nFRIED SMASHED POTATOES with neck bone gravy 4\\nGIANT LIMA BEANS with smoked ham hocks 4\\nCRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUT LEAVES golden raisins-pecorino 5\\n\\nNIMAN RANCH SLOW-COOKED BEEF CHEEKS soft polenta, cippolinis 14\\nCANDIED PORK BELLY collard greens, soy balsamic syrup 12\\nPETITE BONE-IN FILETS mushroom, bone marrow red wine sauce 18\\n\\nWARM CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES vanilla sauce 5\\n\\nFORIS, Pinot Noir, Willamette Valley, Oregon 40, 10 glass\\nHOUGE GENESIS, Chardonnay, Washington 36, 9 glass\\nSeveral of the house drinks, as well.\\n\\nThe duck fat fries were absurd.  I don't know what a 110 minute egg is (looked like a soft-poached egg and tasted like one too), but the fries were.... Amazeballs.  I was skeptical after trying a similar dish at Hank's Garage that turned out to be okay, but pretty bland.  Even my \\"I eat healthy and no sugar and no real butter\\" father was impressed to hell.  Truly outstanding effort.\\n\\nI enjoyed the bone marrow, but felt that for $10, they could have given me more; all I got was a single bone, eight to ten inches long, split in half.  The herb salad was tasty, though.\\n\\nThose oyster boudin fritters?  Home run number two.  My I-Used-To-Live-In-Louisiana boyfriend and my I-Traveled-Around-The-World-Dammit father LOVED them. I think Nick is going to make me come back just for these.  Two fist-size balls of boudin, fried, with a nice oyster in the middle.  Nomlish!  Also don't neglect the chipotle remoulade; it was surprisingly tasty, and followed with a nice sharp bite.\\n\\nThe fried smashed potatoes are actually whole finger potatoes fried with no batter and salted.  If you like potatoes, you'll like these (a lot), but probably my least favorite of the bunch (I'm not a potato man, that's the boyfriend's job).\\n\\nDad horded the lima beans, so I didn't get to try them, but given how empty the plate was, I'm guessing he liked them.\\n\\nThe crispy brussel sprout leaves?  Loved 'em.  Nice and crunchy, with an almost sugary sauce (that you couldn't even see, and reminded me of my own balsamic reduction I use on roasted root vegetables).  I did see a bit of room for improvement; the leaves were still a bit chewy, and could've used a few more minutes being cooked.  I do kale in a similar manner, and very much enjoyed them.  I'll probably try to emulate this at home.\\n\\nThe boyfriend did the beef cheeks.  They were not at all what I expected:  I had been told they're the most tender, tastiest part of our dear bovine friends, but never had the chance to try them.  They were very tender, and the sauce was good, but I couldn't taste the mint on the meat at all.  I could taste it in the polenta (which was tasty), but on a whole, I just wasn't \\"wowed\\" by the dish.\\n\\nI ordered the candied pork belly, and I'm just not sure how I feel about it.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the soy balsamic 'syrup' (that was not syrupy at all), and the collard greens were Tasty McTasterton, but I guess I don't love pork belly that much.\\n\\nMy Pop?  Man, he effing WON.  The petite bone-in filets were.... MOUTHGASM WARNING.  So tender, so flavorful, so fantastic.  Lightly peppered, the filets were roughly fist-sized with just a bit of bone on the side, and covered with chewy tender mushrooms. Like sexy steaky butter that melts in a mouthgasm of flavor.  Just... wow.\\n\\nNew favorite in town?  Yes.  Be back?  OH yes.

While it is traditionally listed and is one of the oldest and most established restaurants in the city, other steakhouses are just better in most categories.\\n\\nI'm going to break this into sections here:\\nDecor - If your style hails to the days of Dean Martin and the rat pack, then this place is definitely for you. It is white linen, although that's covered by neat folds of butcher paper. Everything from the tables, booths, chairs and fixtures do not seem to have been updated for 20+ years. And there is a seeming glaze of brown throughout that I have seen in other restaurants that used to allow smoking but haven't repainted/papered since the smoking ban went into effect. I give 1 of 5 for decor.\\n\\nRoom - This place is usually packed with a somewhat older haughty crowd, even with reservations, we waited 15 minutes to be seated while they went through their walk-in list, what's the point of reservations? The dining room itself is very crowded, with waiters zooming past bumping chairs and elbows. We were fortunate enough to get a booth, but the space in the booth was seemingly squished, even for just two. 1 of 5 again for this.\\n\\nService - While the server provided us with excellent service, the recommendations seemed rehearsed based on daily specials and not based on personal recommendations. Our server had no clue about wine recommendations and even commented that he should try the wine we ordered. Also, due to the volume of people in the restaurant, our service was lagging and a bit impersonal. 3 out of 5 for service.\\n\\nWine List - Most higher class steakhouses have a dedicated wine steward (or someone on their bar staff) that is responsible for keeping the wine list up to date and their stock matching what is listed. We ordered two separate bottles of wine, both of which were out, finally settling on a third choice. With the speed of service, we finally got our wine about 25 minutes later. This is unacceptable, 1 of 5 stars.\\n\\nFood - ah finally, the food section, being the most expensive portion of the check, (steaks averaging 20-30), it only makes sense to give a thorough review of the food. Again, speed of order to serving of food was an issue. In the meantime, our fairly meager cheese, fruit and cracker appetizer arrived, along with some assorted breads. Our steaks arrived, my wife's small filet was well prepared and made from a good cut, however my porterhouse seemed as if it was cut from a bad section, I had plenty of tough cartilage and gristle to work through to get to the tender meat portions. I think better trimming by the chef would have also made a better impression. However, medium rare was achieved to a very satisfying degree. The side dishes that accompany the main course (but charged separately) were very good. Lastly, for dessert , and the highlight of our meal was the banana cream pie, if there's anything that I would return to this restaurant for, the pie would be it. Being tough to rate, I would say 3 of 5 for food.\\n\\nPrice - Two people, one bottle of wine, one appetizer, two steaks, two sides and dessert rang in around $120. This is about the same as other steakhouses in Columbus, but I am critical on the point that it is not worth the price. Considering I have had a better steak at a texas roadhouse grill, I will not be returning here for steak, but may stop by again for dessert.\\n\\nAll in all, if you're going to be spending $100+ on a dinner date, try one of the spacious cameron mitchell establishments, or one of the larger chain upscales around downtown."},{"name":"Amaya's Taco Village","address":"5804 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent authentic Mexican!

Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone due to the slow service and careless waiters."},{"name":"Waves Coffee House","address":"180 - 5951 No 3 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"free parking....\\n\\neven a private room that you can book for those important meetings."},{"name":"H√§agen-Dazs","address":"1148 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Super yummy!

We were greeted and seated right away.  UCF game was on so it was a little loud but to be expected since it's over by UCF.  It took us about 10 minutes to have anyone come over and take our drink order.  We were just thinking of leaving when the waitress showed up.  We placed our drink orders which were brought out by some guy that was more interested in watching the game then making sure to sit the drinks on coasters where were too far in front of us for him to reach.  Then he stood right by our table watching the game for a few minutes and it made us a little uncomfortable.  After our drinks were delivered, our waitress finally came back to take our order.  We tried the Irish nachos which my husband had read were really good and they were. He had the fish and chips (with sweet potato fries as a substitute.)  Fish was a little too greasy and not much flavor.  Needs more spices or something.  He wouldn't get it again. I had the spinach chicken salad which was pretty good.  The dressing that it comes with though seemed a little spicy/hot and I would have gotten a different dressing if I knew. It was ok but a little too spicy for me. I like spicy but just not on my salad usually.  For dessert we had Tilted Guilt which is supposedly a warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top. It was ok but the cookie was basically warm cookie dough and not really baked at all.  All in all it was an ok experience but I don't see myself rushing back especially after we got the bill.  For pub style food, we could have gotten way more somewhere else for the money we thought."},{"name":"Casablanca Restaurant","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"This review is for the restaurant/bar, not the cafe. \\n\\nI have to say, it's simply okay. It's a dimly lit restaurant that is below street level. Quite noisy, at least on a Saturday evening. Food is pretty decent. We had a pretty good roasted eggplant with caramelized figs and goat cheese appetizer. The seafood stew was a little too salty for me but the beef brisket was pretty good. Seems to be a popular place for the seniors to dine in, though I saw a few middle-aged and younger people as well. The pumpkin cheesecake dessert was pretty good, but overall nothing to rave about and a little on the pricey side so I probably won't be coming back."},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"A vegan-friendly diner!? My dreams have come true.\\n\\nAfter a botched attempt at visiting The Pulse Cafe which had closed, we decided to visit Veggie Galaxy as it was on our way home. It was a COLD day and we ended up parking blocks away. We arrived a little bit after 3 PM only to find out that the kitchen had closed. Usually this would be reason for me to never return. However, the menu was too appealing.\\n\\nOn my next visit, the kitchen was open and I dined on Vegan Stuffed French Toast, a Tofu Egg, and a Chocolate Frappe. The Egg by itself  left a lot to be desired but probably works better when loaded up with veggies/other toppings. The rest of my meal was delicious. My friend had a Kendall Square Mushroom Chickpea Burger and Pecan Pie for dessert. This non-veggie friend was happy with his food :) My only complaint was when I tried to order a side of Homefries, I was informed that the kitchen was closed. Again, it was 3. (The bakery at the front of the restaurant remains open at this time).Since my meal was so good, I decided to overlook this annoyance.\\n\\nAfter thoroughly investigating the menu on the visit, I knew exactly what I would get once I returned another time for dinner: Vegan Baked Mac and Cheese and a Banana Split! And return I did. My Mac and Cheese came with an added veggie option (eggplant, leeks, and peas). Although I never liked anything added to my mac and cheese when I used to eat the real thing, I tried it. I still prefer it additive-free, but the veggies worked. Needless to say, my Banana Split was to-die-for! Exactly as I remember. The non-veggie bf ordered a Cambridge Street Omelet and said it was the best omelet he had ever had (real eggs in this one). On the way to the bathroom (which includes environmentally-friendly toilets), I shamelessly eyed other guests' meals which looked equally appetizing. I can't wait to return and try out other menu items!"},{"name":"Gen Sou En","address":"299 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"This place used to be my favorite spot to get some work done with a cup of tea.

I like the location - I met a friend here twice when on business in Boston. One time I was staying at the Hilton Doubletree, a close walk, another time I was on Newbury Street and another pleasant walk, at least in summer. \\n\\nI found the menu to have a nice variety. The ambiance was bustling and friendly as were the waitstaff. Both times I had a delicious salmon dish though I must admit other items on the menu tempted me., such as the half chicken. My friend got a burger and salad and both got the thumbs up. Portions were generous and everything was fresh. \\n\\nI'm also under the impression this place is open really late, even on weekdays, perhaps being close to theaters. Though I haven't ever gone there too late, it's an option I will consider (I don't see hours on their web site but Google's hours, which are usually fairly accurate, claim they are open late). I will definitely consider heading back to this spot, it's a nice place for an informal evening with a friend, quality meal at good Boston price."},{"name":"Dirty Martin's Place","address":"2808 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great hole in the wall grease trap with a knack for curing hangovers.\\n\\nhttp://thefatartery.blogspot.com/2011/03/dirty-martins-austin-tx.html"},{"name":"The Red Wagon","address":"2128 East Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The line up was out the door when we got there.
