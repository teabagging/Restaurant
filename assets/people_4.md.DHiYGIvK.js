Every time I've eaten here, the food has been outstanding.  I love how they print their menu daily and list all their fresh seafood at the top, so you know what's going to be really good that day.  And because they print their menus daily, they can do cool things like put, \\"Happy Birthday Jane\\" at the top of the menu if you're there for a special occasion.  Nice.\\n\\nTheir raspberry iced tea is out of this world.  I could drink a gallon of that stuff every day.  I also love their calamari - and that dessert with the dark chocolate bowl with the espresso mouse and fresh berries?  *Insanely* good.  \\n\\nThe only thing I can think of that would make this experience better is easier parking.  I called to ask where to park last time I went, and the woman who answered the phone was clearly clueless and didn't bother to ask anyone else.  She mumbled something about valet, but didn't know how much it cost or where to access it.  Every time I've gone, I've either ended up parking on the street, in a paid lot, or just walking the several blocks from my office so I don't have to hassle with finding a spot for the car.\\n\\nOtherwise, great place to find a stellar meal."},{"name":"One Saigon","address":"979 Hornby St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"A coworker recommended this place for lunch, so we took a stroll down the street to check it out.

I was a little worried she would be hungry again in an hour, at least with the baguette, the bread makes it look a bit bigger than it is, even though its really just filler.\\n\\nThe place is small and not very busy (which should always be a sign, since most places downtown get smokin crazy during lunch hours).

She had the house red which was fine and I had the sangria which was a little too sweet for me but still tasted OK.\\n\\nWe started with the cacciatore and soft goat's milk cheese. Growing up in a predominantly Italian area in the NY/NJ area this was a common antipasta and this version of it was good. Not the best 've ever had but it was well executed and worth the money. 3 stars.\\n\\nNext we started with the gazpacho and the chorizo + sweet-sour figs. The gazpacho had a nice flavor to it, not bland but not overly spicy either. 4 stars. The chorizo and figs were excellent as well. The sausage was very good and the caramelized brown sugar reduction on the figs was a dinner highlight for me. 5 stars.\\n\\nNext was the snapper a la plancha and short rib shooters. The snapper was well cooked but too mild in flavor for me. My wife likes her fish bland so she enjoyed it more than I did but the salsa verde just needed something more to make it pop. 3 stars. The short ribs were excellent. Tender and flavorful and the horseradish sauce was well balanced. 4.5 stars.\\n\\nWe ended dinner with espresso and flan. The espresso was very good but if you are one of those coffee addicts that want it to be thick as mud then you will be disappointed. It had a full flavor without being overwhelming. 4 stars.\\n\\nThe flan was the best surprised all night. I'm not a fan of this but my wife thought that since this is a Spanish themed restaurant then we should go with it. She could not have been more right.

Looking around the main entry room, they even had one table set up to the left in front of the counter, in which they display their meats, pierogis, and desserts.  The atmosphere seems rather inviting, as if you were in mama's kitchen at home.  A young man was briskly wandering the front room/deli and dining room, doing all he possibly could.  That kind of hustle is something I haven't seen in a restaurant in a LONG time.  We were the youngest couple in the place by at least 1 generation.

It went fantastically with the meal.  The kielbasa was a decent size, and the pierogis were also, but they were drowning in grease.  Additionally, they didn't provide any sour cream for the pierogis, you have to ask for it.  Who doesn't serve sour cream with pierogis?  The presentation of the meal wasn't really there, and the food looked rather empty on the plate.  \\n\\nThe overall bill wasn't too bad considering the large beers we both got, but I still felt it was a tad overpriced.  Luckily, we had a discount from Half off Depot to use that knocked $20 off the price.  I think overall it was a good meal, but not a place I would frequent.

It's not tomato based, it's on the creamy almost gravy like consistency. I have to say my favorite part of the meal was the biscuits.

The sweet crepes were filled with fresh fruits and Nutella, and the savory crepe was loaded with fresh lettuce and chicken. Definitely filling and not thin at all. Haven't tried anything besides the crepes, since this was our first visit. But if you're looking for good crepes in the NorthShore, this is by far the best place to go! They have a huge menu selection, so chances are if you're craving something, they've got it. Only wish they were open all day. Also, customer service is shockingly pleasant.

It's a little out of the way, requiring some driving past ranches and farm land to give you a true dose of what perhaps you came for. That's part of the charm of it.\\nOnce you arrive, you can park in a rather rustic parking lot, and grab a number from the hostess, because odds are there will be a little bit of a wait on the weekends. In the meantime, they had a live musician crooning an ode to barbecue at the Salt Lick on a Sunday. If you're starving, there's fresh squeezed lemonade and popcorn to munch on in the meantime. But honestly, sometimes it's nice to enjoy a little bit of Texas sunshine while you wait for your meal.\\nAfter you're called to your table, you'll enter through a building, and pass their famous open hearth smoker. This is something to see. Unlike the other barbecue institutions that we visited, the stone hearth smoker is off to the side of a dining room, tended to by weathered pit masters, who are sopping the meat with the Salt Lick's famous sauce. The addition of sauce is a little unusual for Texas for those in the know. But it's good sauce.\\nSo the deal with this restaurant is that you can get \\"family style\\" or all you can eat for your order. Since we had been really gorging on meat over the past twenty-four hours at other places, we opted out of this option (but you should totally go for it if you are only visiting one place!). We ordered the plate.\\nThe plate you can order, three meats, and sides of beans, and pickles, and cole slaw is a pretty good serving, though I probably could have eaten more. By the time it arrived, I was starving. The brisket was on par with that which we had at Kreuz Market in Lockhart, though a little bit more moist. The smoke was not as pronounced, probably since this meat was produced by way of an open smoker. But this was not a bad thing. The meat was still delicious and tender. The sauce that they mop on added a little bit of a sweet mustard zing. Likewise, the ribs were delicious. You only receive one large rib on the plate, so you better enjoy it. The meat had a great chew to it, tender, but not fall off the bone. The smoke flavor penetrated the pork just a bit more than the brisket. The sausage at the Salt Lick is the most different than the other places that we had visited. It's actually more like the Polish Kielbasa sausage. Not as peppery, much smoother, though a nice change from the other varieties that we had tried. Since this sausage was pre-sliced on the plate, it also lost a little bit of the \\"oooh, look at the snap!\\" quality that we had enjoyed so much elsewhere.\\nThe big surprise? The sides! The beans were excellent! Smokey and a little toothsome. Also, the cole slaw was vinegary and crunchy, breaking up the meatfest with a \\"look ma, we ate our vegetables\\" sentiment just enough. At other places we had visited, those in the know had advised against order any sides which allegedly would taste like the crap I can get in a Stop and Shop can back home. (Furthermore, I come from the land of the baked bean... so, odds are I would be disappointed.) But I was pretty happy about the side dishes here. \\nIn summary, I enjoyed the Salt Lick. It didn't rank as high as Smitty's or Luling City Market, but it was worth the trip. The atmosphere, and the food are definitely worth the trip."},{"name":"Umeda Japanese Cuisine","address":"1157 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I would say that this place offers a decent deal for downtown restaurants.

We were a little annoyed that they would not take a Visa card. They said that it was cash only or they accepted Canadian credit cards.  What the heck? A chase credit card that is internationally accepted is not accepted here? They said that they wouldn't bc of issues with fraud but we have never encountered something like this before. We were also annoyed that she only put one pair of chopsticks in our to go bag even though she clearly saw that there were two people. When we asked for another napkin, she looked miffed bc she had put one in the bag. Oh my gosh, it's just a napkin. My daughter needed to wipe her nose.

A song later the bodyguard came to tell me and the other young lady to move out of the entire vicinity of Snoop. I was appalled that she would request this because this was the biggest area in the establishment that a few people could dance in together. I feel that if she did not want anyone near her she should have been behind one of the velvet ropes of the business.

But, having gone to school in Austin for 4 years and visiting Austin very frequently every year, to me, Salt Lick is more about the experience than just about the food. I've been to Salt Lick before, during, and after college football games, for wedding rehearsal dinners, after a long day of tubing--it's a great place to hang out and eat.  And, on that note, the food is good, too!\\n\\nSitting all the way out in Driftwood, Texas, you have to drive to the Salt Lick.  It's a dry county, so you have to (or, in my opinion, get to) bring your own alcohol, meaning you can bring coolers and coolers of whatever you like to drink.\\n\\nRemember to BRING CASH because you won't get to taste anything of anything without some green.  Luckily, they have an ATM in the restaurant, so you won't have to drive back to Austin for some moula.\\n\\nWhen you get there, you'll likely be waiting for a table.  I went a couple of weeks ago, and, though the hostess said my wait would be an hour for a party of 11, we got seated in less than half an hour.  That may have been luck, but it's always a pleasant surprise!\\n\\nWhile you're waiting, you can buy some freshly squeezed lemonade.  And, quite frequently, there is a live singer or band playing for all the people who are waiting.\\n\\nMost people order the family style:  that's all you can eat of pork ribs, sausage, brisket, coleslaw, potatoes, beans, and bread.  Everything is REALLY good.  Of note, Salt Lick serves up all kinds of brisket--fatty, lean, charred, you name it.  I've had different cuts in one sitting--it just depends on what is on your plate or if you request something.\\n\\nThe barbecue sauce is so good, that they'll bottle it up and sell it to you.  My friend has a whole caseload of the stuff at his place.\\n\\nFor an extra $5, you can add one beef rib to your family style.  I did that for the first time a couple of weeks ago.  The rib was huge, and the meat melted right off the bone.\\n\\nIf you have room for dessert, which I often times do not, then try their pies and ice cream.

We came for lunch on an extremely, extremely hot summer day. Part of my excitement walking into Flour was the AC and I was smiling when I first walked in because there is a vent by the door. However, there is only one vent in this establishment and the line was out of the door, so you can only imagine the body heat emitting from everyone. The line was long and it was hot as hell - extremely uncomfortable. \\n\\nI ordered the tofu quinoa salad (seems light and refreshing). Tell me why I took a bite and my mouth was burning. Nowhere on the menu did it mention anything about \\"spicy\\" or \\"hot\\" or \\"chili flakes,\\" and I double checked, too. One thing that I will never understand about restaurants is that they would have their menu look cute and hipster by saying \\"Tofu Quinoa Salad: arugula, soy spread, edamame\\" instead of mentioning that it is extremely spicy and people may not like that. This was obviously a turnoff because I do not enjoy spicy food at all and thus did not eat it. \\n\\nFlour Bakery is quaint and nicely decorated and possesses the new warehouse vibe that every restaurant seems to have nowadays.

I have ordered four times this past month and while the pizza is good,  the first order I got was cold,  I said nothing though.  The second was mildly warm.  The third arrived to my child's school late but not as cold. Today,  I didn't even get an order!  Paid for a pizza to be delivered and after an hour and a half nothing.  I called and was met with the rudest phone operator I've ever encountered.  She blamed me for the error!  \\"Well you ordered carry out\\" no. I didn't.  Same women who last time admitted there was an issue with their site causing my last order to not ring up correctly.  So she knows the site has had issue yet still blames.  In any case,  how about just finding a solution.  I was appalled by her snapping at me and said okay well I selected delivery but what happens now I have a hungry four year old.  The woman then decided to snap at me \\"if you would let me finish!  It will take another hour to deliver you a pizza!\\" So now we are rude, accusatory, offer no apologies or solutions and just snort it will take another hour.  Good way to do business! I told her to forget it. She didn't care,  said okay and hung up. Nice.  A few mins later I tried to call to get confirmation my AMEX would be refunded but no answer.  Seems purposely so I can't ask for her manager.  I've sent an email to complain and I'm expecting her to intercept that as well.  Sad how bad employees cost businesses money.  All she had to do was say \\"Uh oh something happened there, we had carry out. Don't worry we will get this right out to you\\". I suppose that was too dificult a task and being a rude accusatory imbecile was more fun.  My husband has the car seat so my four year old and I will be walking in 40 degree weather to get food.

The way Amy Ma welcomes you when you first enter; how the server smiles, surprised when your Caucasian dinner-mate actually orders her food in Mandarin. The way the food comes out with the wok-essence infused, visibly floating upward, intertwined with the rising steam. Dumplings cooked to perfection, balancing the pan fried outer texture with the heavenly ingredients within. Entrees prepared with copious amounts of oil, leaving residual spoonfuls only adding to the flavor, multiplying the desired effects.

Not a morsel of food is left. Mandarin being spoken in the kitchen carries out and fills the dining area mingling with noise from the meeting in back.

For mains, I had the Bacon Cheddar Burger with Caramelized Onions, but sans oyster add-on. ($16).  It was well cooked and flavorful, certainly a good choice, and for those who like seafood (I don't) I imagine quite nice with the extra add-ons.  My wife had the Warm Buttered Lobster Roll ($32).  Really sampling the Lobster Roll was our primary objective of visiting Row 34, particularly after all of the positive Yelp! Reviews.  A very generous portion of lobster was nestled in the buttery roll and served with potato chips.  The flavors were there, but sadly said lobster seemed to be overcooked to the point of being on the chewy side (both of our opinions).  Rather disappointing given its one of their signature dishes but perhaps we caught it on an off day over a holiday weekend.\\n\\nOne thing I must give Row 34 kudos on is their beer and wine list - it's a great selection and plenty of tempting options which pair quite well with the menu.

Congrats on the 2 year anniversary and I hope your nerve damage gets better, btw. \\n\\nI asked the waitress for her favorite dish and she recommended the salmon fettuccine with tomato/marinara sauce. I also selected the small calamari and garlic bread.\\n\\nThe food came out incredibly quick, I had barely had a few minutes alone with my calamari before the nice server came back with my main course. Fresh, shredded parmesan on top of course. \\n\\nThe salmon was delicious, very moist and great fresh flavor. The pasta was cooked perfectly and a nice flavor. I just wanted a bit more WOW from the sauce. More flavor from the dish, just kind of tasted like a noodley, marinara salmon. Which although delicious, I expected more. \\n\\nThe calamari was good but nothing amazing - I again expected more. The garlic bread on the other hand was great! Very nice mix of olive oil and garlic with pesto it seems like. \\n\\nOverall, great and quick service. I would definitely come back because I think there were things on the menu that would be better for my taste buds. I regret not trying the veal parmesan. \\n\\nIf you like sitting on your neighbors laps - I would say come on down, the coziness adds to the fun of the atmosphere."},{"name":"Pizzicato Pizza - Westmoreland","address":"1630 SE Bybee Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We just discovered the Pizzicato near Sellwood.

It's the generic club mix and 90's hip hop songs that you find at any club. The atmostphere is...well, one side is pretty awesome with white couches and white drapes, then the other side looks like it's out of a motel nightclub...kinda dank and dark...so it doesn't flow very well.  The other thing that doesn't flow so well is the bar...it's the smallest bar I've ever seen and there are only 2 tenders that work behind it.  Which on a busy, crowded and thirsty Saturday night...you have to wait for your drink for awhile. My solution, go downstairs. There is a very lovely restaurant that is also part of Circa (i haven't eaten there so I don't know how the food is).  But the bar down there is very large and well stocked.

You can get a tasty Fenway Frank (exact same variety as the stadium dogs) for only $1 compared to the $4.50 price tag at the field.  They have a wide range of extras you can also include for only a buck more.  In addition to the dogs they have a great variety of other menu options. I'm partial to the buffalo mac & cheese (though the menu insults your \\"fat ass\\" when you order it with extras) and the homemade pretzels (they come with a delicious spicy mustard or a cheese dip).  Lower Depths also has a couple options for Tater Tot plates.  I split one with a friend once and it was pretty good, but didn't measure up to favorites I've mentioned above. \\n\\nThe atmosphere in Lower Depths is casual and they have a fantastic beer selection.

It's a fun place to catch up with friends after work, grab a bite before the Sox game or stuff your face with tasty food. \\n\\nAnd while I've always enjoyed my experiences there I dropped my rating from 5 stars to 4 because Lower Depths only takes cash.

I'm simply someone lucky to have lived in great food cities who gets a lot of joy from good food, a comfortable atmosphere and reasonable prices.  Friends tell me I need to stop comparing Portland to Chicago.  How can I when Portland insists on charging a premium for its goods and services?  It has put itself on that shelf and has fallen short everywhere I have explored.  Neighbors insisted I try Pok Pok NW (only a few blocks from our building).  I ordered the first item under House Specialties (and the dish that everyone recommended), the Fish Sauce Chicken Wings.\\n\\nWhat am I missing?  The wings were good.  I ordered them spicy, but they lacked heat.  The fish sauce flavor was interesting, but far from revolutionary.  And yet, Pok Pok NW is charging $15+ for six (6) of them.  15 of them for $6 would have been closer to appropriate since I have had equally good wings with similar flavors at corner markets.  The atmosphere and service were average.  I am lost for any reason to go back.  After a full year living in Portland, I can count on one hand the number of eateries that I have left feeling like the quality of my experience was greater than the quantity I paid.\\n\\nSadly, Portland (and Portlanders) seem oblivious to what makes a food city world class.  Where is the uniqueness locals rave about?  It's not in the Pearl, downtown, or anywhere on 23rd.  Putting cereal on a doughnut should never be a culinary claim to fame.

I also like the fact that they made the bathrooms bigger, so it is not one person at a time for the ladies room anymore. i wanted to have the chocolate cupcake. Next time, I will go back and get that. The only problem with inside is that they said they did not have peanut butter syrup and to look at the menu, which i did and it was there. i had a refreshing chocolate mint caramel milkshake.

The portion size is quite sufficient. The food is standard fare and nothing spectacular. Service is attentive enough, but don't expect the wait staff to be too friendly.

I might try it again for a korean bbq fix in the area, but there are definitely other better places (but pricier too) for sushi fix. \\n\\nParking can be a challenge since it's all metered parking (on street and in a public lot close by), though you could still have trouble finding a free spot most of the time. It's a very short walk from the Coolidge Corner T stop, so it's a better bet to use public transport.

In fact, I have never waited less than 45 minutes to get seated, even with a reservation.  And as some other customers have pointed out, the hostess is never apologetic about the wait.  For this reason, I will rarely go here on a weekend night.  Reservations and just walking in on a weekend night, however,  tends to be fine.  \\n-Loud Atmosphere in Bar Area:  If you are hoping to have a conversation with others at your dinner table, pray that you are seated in the dining room and not in the bar area.

I've been to Pizzeria Trianon in Naples and Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix (arguably the best in the US), and the differences are clear cut. Rather than the airy, bubbly crust that rings true Neapolitan pizza, Antico's crust is very heavy and doughy (two of our pizzas weren't entirely cooked through--an excessively high temperature was probably the culprit). Also, and I know a lot of people are going to have beef with this, but I wasn't a fan of the peppers on the san gennaro--they were pickled red peppers, which I thought were a little out of place and distracted from the delicious sausage, caramelized onion and smoky, slightly charred crust.

It took a long time for her to even come to our table - she was too busy socializing with a couple who were seated at a hightop table in the bar section. This table was right next to/ a little above table. After coming over and taking order, she went back to the same couple and continued to socialize. We had to wave and distract her from her conversation when we needed something..

I've been to Morton's, S&W, Flemmings, Abe and Louis, and many of the other great steakhouses in the country. Ruth Chris was one of the few I just hadn't made it to yet. So I made reservations to take my GF for her birthday. Probably the best decision I've ever made. From the moment I stepped out of my car with my GF and walked up to the building it's in, I was amazed. Such a nice building and little courtyard outside. Then when you walked in, you a greeted with dim but gorgeous dark wooden surroundings. I had let them know in the reservation form online that it was my GFs birthday so if they could do something per their protocol, that would be nice, but I wasn't expecting  much. But they had a nice table setup and it was covered in birthday glitter. I thought that was an extremely nice touch seeing as I didn't ask for any of that. We sat in a beautiful and cozy room with several other tables. We were greeted almost instantly by one of the many super attentive and gracious staff. Drinks and apps were promptly ordered and then we got bread and everything went as smooth as you could possibly ask for. The steak was one of the better steaks I've ever had. I ordered an 8oz filet with twin lobster tails. The steak was perfect, just perfect. Cooked to absolute perfection with just the right amount of flavor and tenderness. And the twin lobster tails were some of the freshest and most delectable seafood I've ever tasted. My GF got the same thing, and said the same things about her order. Then they surprised her with a huge dessert plate that said happy birthday on it. Just one more incredibly nice touch to please their guests. I couldn't possibly recommend this restaurant more.

We called in an order for a simple pepperoni pizza for pick up. I arrived after the projected cooking time and stood \\"in line\\" in an empty shop for over ten minutes. I felt very invisible. There were two people at the cashiers that never looked up and were openly complaining about tips. Eventually a different worker noticed me and asked if I had been helped yet, to which I replied, pleasantly,\\" no, not yet! All I need is to pick up my order.\\" He turned the cashier's computer around and prompted me to check myself out. The computer then prompted me to give a 10,15,20or 25% tip. Why am I required to tip for a pick up order when I received no service whatsoever? Once I checked myself out I waited again for at least 5 minutes to be handed the pizza which was right in front of me. I had to ask to have it handed to me.

I perhaps should have thought about that a bit longer. We tried the crab cakes - just ok, a bit overcooked. I got one of the entrees, pumpkin risotto. I've had al dente, and this was on the dente side of that. Hard to eat, and just not very satisfying after a few bites. My wife had the lamb panini - which I tried, but it did not have the right cheese-to-meat ratio - all I could taste was the chevre inside. When I have a lamb sandwich, I would like to taste that lamb, thank you. My entree came with a salad I didn't know was coming, so I didn't get to caution them about dressing on the side - so of course it was drenched. I did have a good aussie beer, and the ice cream/brownie concoction they offer for dessert was yummy. The server mentioned that he was having a tiff with the kitchen staff, and that he'd called the owner about it.

I refused the free dessert.\\n\\nEleven, the restaurant in the new Loew's Atlanta in midtown, is a bit like the pretty girl you finally get up the nerve to approach, but then turns out to be nothing special; in fact, she turns out to be, well, all kinds of weird. Walking into the swank hotel lobby, everything seemed to be in order - doors were opened, greetings exchanged, and we were led quickly to a comfortable booth by the window. On a Thursday evening the dining room was mostly empty, but the bar was lively and filled with young hipster-types sipping pretty colored cocktails.\\n\\nThe first sign of trouble came when ordering drinks; our server was not of age, and had obviously never poured a glass of wine in her young life. Though apologetic, it took almost thirty full minutes to get our order. (And I counted no less than eight people manning the bar; couldn't one of them have stepped in and helped?) Even our appetizer of duck confit pizzetta made it to our table in less time. More weirdness--the pizzetta was unevenly cooked, and served at room temperature.\\n\\nThere were few highlights. The bread basket had decent cheese straws, a nod to their supposed Southern theme, and the sourdough bread was appropriately crispy and chewy. The meat entrees seem to work. An order of beef tenderloin was nicely cooked and flavorful. But a side order of wood-grilled asparagus was instead served steamed, and was covered with a heap of Parmesan cheese that looked - and tasted - as if it were poured straight from the green Kraft can. My husband enjoyed his beef short rib sandwich, and devoured the crispy ztf fries. ZTF? Zulu tango foxtrot? No, zero trans fat. Or as our server said, \\"Healthy fries!\\" But my local vegetable escabeche was a sorry mess, the only discernible flavor that of vinegar, which resulted in the baby carrots tasting exactly like the okra. The only way to tell these very different veggies apart was the texture. (The okra was a little mushier.) And the sourdough bread with house-made tapenade was over-salted and one-note.\\n\\nI'm all for giving the kitchen a chance to work out its problems, but the first thing that needs improvement is the service. There are certain expectations of high-end luxury hotel chains, and Loew's needs to learn from the likes of the W and the Four Seasons.

It's still in the glove box. \\n\\n7/10/09 Here's the unabridged version of the above: \\n\\nWe made a reservation for the evening of 3/22. We arrived 15 minutes early. Our table wasn't ready. We understood. We were seated at the bar, and assured our wait would be a few minutes. While I don't remember how long it took to be seated, I do remember ordering two 3 course dinners. From entry to exit our Craigie experience spanned two or more hours. During which, we watched neighboring tables enviously as they were served attentively six or more courses in less time, AND seated after us. We watched our waiter flit obliviously from one end of the restaurant to the other, while 40 minutes passed between the second and third course. We watched a young man appearing to be the manager scan our foodless table several times without a single word, or action. Our waiter did not receive support from his manager, or fellow wait staff. Instead, they let a coworker drown, and ultimately, Craigie fail, due to the lack of a simple imperative - communication. \\n\\nThere was confusion in the kitchen as the wait staff piled behind the pass. No explanation was offered. No apologies were made until we were at the door. A young man appearing to be in his early thirties, dressed in a black, over sized sport coat asked, \\"How was everything?\\" We told him the truth, \\"The service ruined our meal.\\" After working a LONG Sunday, the last thing we wanted was to spend 2-3 hours in a restaurant whose prices indicate that service will be part of the meal. \\n\\nWe were given a $50 gift cert. by the man appearing to be the manager. It was thoughtful, but today, a common gesture among restaurants that hope you'll return after a miserable experience. We should have been comped for that meal, that evening. I don't want the chef sending his complements.  At 10 pm, I want him/her to work on my meal. Offering a gift certificate with the hope of enticing us to return was a long shot.

A shop that sells power cords, a convenience store that seems mostly geared toward selling lottery tickets. What appears to be a defunct nightclub in the basement.

I know cus I did my research before I went there!  There are basically two freaking awesome reasons this place is so highly rated.  That's the lure - bite?\\n\\n- 30 minutes outside Austin - a nice drive through hill country.  \\n- BYOB - yes, that's right.  Freaking awesome.  Apparently people roll up with Kegs and get down.  Can you say one star?\\n- All you can eat option.  ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ for less than $20.   What? What?   Give this man another star!\\n- Very good meat but they use an open fire pit so the meat doesn't get very smokey.  It's also a bit drier than I'd like. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but just not great.  Half star.\\n- The fire pit is like an icon.  You can worshp before it.  They'll let you get behind the counter, take pictures of it, take pictures with it, take pictures with the staff.  Hell, they even gave me a tong and let me pick up a rack of ribs over the flame and take a picture with it.  Yes, one star for being all around good folk.\\n- But, the place has a bit of a commercial feel to it at times.  The wine cellar was really a surprise ... I didn't expect to see that there.  And they were selling pretty hard on the sauces, dry rubs, shirts, and sign up for the mailing list.  Not horrible but I just wanna eat my bbq.  Lose a 1/2 star.\\n\\nSo, I'm thinking 3.0 stars.  The very tasty peach cobbler almost pushed it  to four stars but not quite.  But you should definitely have a slice!\\n\\nNot a bad place to go to if you're in Austin and doing a BBQ circuit.

However, the building and new design is much nicer than other locations I've been to. \\n\\nI'll start with the food.... I ordered the Zinger mountain melt which came by way of a normal double plate rather than a long cast iron serving platter that I've seen at other locations. The fries were slightly warm at best and the chicken maybe slightly better. The kitchen didn't seem that busy so why these quick, deep fried, ingredients weren't cooked fresh is beyond me. I saw my plate sitting in the Window for a few mins as well, I'm sure that contributed to its temperature. The quality was good, the hot teriyaki sauce I got on the zingers was done well. Overall the dish was fine. \\n\\nDuring my time there I sat at the inside bar with bartenders Carlos and Chelly. I sat down and was promptly greeted by Carlos whom immediately extended his hand out for a friendly handshake. I was impressed by this. Chelly was nice as well until her friends came to the bar at which point the service declined and almost had to wave my ticket in her face to check out after 15mins of my CC sitting on the receipt. She then ran my card and handed me no pen. It wasn't until Carlos passed me again that I was finally able to get a pen form him, sign my bill and leave.\\n\\nOverall in my opinion it's a missed opportunity to impress folks who are willing to try the place again. \\n\\nHowever, with all of this said - it's an excellent place to get a drink and watch the game"},{"name":"Tiki Rock","address":"2 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Slightly disappointed in Tiki Rock.

My favorite part about actual dinner included running around to watch the meat being cooked in the open kitchen. Never seen anything like that!

The experience could not have been any better. \\n\\nFrom convenient and easy valet parking (sorry, I only had $3 to tip valet after dinner. This pains me as I usually tip $5 to honor my own valet parking experience during college), to being greeted by Marco (the owner of Atica Posta) himself, to being seated and settling in with a nice bottle of Prosecco.\\n\\nFrom here we sample two appetizers (Fois Gras and Carpaccio de Manzo) and an Arugula salad, all three well-prepared and delicious. As our entrees we chose the ossobuco and the veal scaloppine piccata. While the first was a HUGE serving, the latter was more modest, but more than adequate. Both were superbly prepared. I could have handled a tad more zest on the piccata, but the dish made up for it with exceedingly tender veal and could have easily held its own in San Gimignano or Siena.\\n\\nThe restaurant was a bit slower than I would have expected on a Thursday at 8 PM, but this made for a very relaxing and quiet dining room. The crowd was mixed, ranging from a 4-top double-date to a couple with their daughter to some business folks, all decidedly middle-class and very Buckhead. The service was exceptional, with EVERYONE from hostess to waitress and even the kitchen staff in top form. Orchestration was perfect and - despite us lingering over our wine and appetizers - never rushed.\\n\\nThe tab was reasonable, not cheap mind you, but one never minds paying for quality, which is the definition of value.

Here's my recommendation: go the \\"from the grill\\" section and order the meals for two.  I don't know how the restaurant thinks two people can eat that much food!  Order an appetizer or two, and everyone will leave full.  The nice thing about ordering from that part of the menu - you get to try out a variety of food!\\n\\nI find their kimchee to be great, but there are so many preferences to kimchee styles, that it's hard to rate.  The cucumber kimchee is pretty light on the spice, but the cabbage leaves definitely pack more of a punch - try the cucumber first if you've never had it before.\\n\\nFor appetizers, I usually order the gyoza.

The beer selections are on par with Brick Store--very impressive for a new place that hasn't had ample time (a couple years) to do a gradual maturation of stock.  With 25+ taps and generally not a single junk among them (unlike Taco Mac which manages to have 25+ taps and 80% being junk), the selection includes brews from almost all known entities among good American breweries at any given time and should make any beer lover very happy.  Offerings change frequently.  Belgium selections are generally about 3 good ones at any given time, so the Brick Store's Belgium bar has this place beat.  The Porter has a larger number of taps in general though and you will find interesting stuff they won't have on tap at the Brick Store (at least, not all at the same time).  I mean these guys would put Dogfish Head 60 minutes and 90 minutes IPA's right next to each other, have multiple pours from Victory, Weyerbacher, Great Divide, and the like, and generally offer an interesting variety of domestic brews.  Also usually have one option that's hand drawn from a cask-conditioned brew, great.  Offer fantastic value tastings packages, bonus.  Have J.W.Lees along with other notable vintages aging away in the cellar, seriousness check.  Bottle selections have just about everything Brick Store carries from a bunch of Cantillons to Hitachino, Trappists from all directions but Wetsvleteren, and some crazy/cheap ones like Crazy Ed's Chili (are you kidding me?) which I'm quite certain is only found at this place.  The cheap (but delicious) section combined with a respectable number of sub-$4 taps actually wins over Brick Store in terms of economy.  Menu is organized by styles with simple descriptions, very likable.  Overall it's just a smash hit as far as being a place to stop by for beer goes.  I love it.  The servers are nowhere near as beer-savvy as the Brick Store guys, but they need time.  \\n\\nFood offerings are decent but a little disappointing.  With known chef-owners and a (somewhat) gastropub theme I expected a little better.  Price sure is consistently low just like the drinks.  I liked the Shrimp BLT and fries.  Hush puppies were not bad.  But the other 4~5 things I tried (Brandade, mussels, shrimp & grits, fish & chips etc.) were all just meh.  I was really disappointed by the shrimp & grits particularly because I had a high expectation.  Nice touch with the truffle oil but overall it just wasn't that great.  It's probably difficult to serve a great S&G when you are only charging $9 for it.  Service can be atrocious if you are sitting in the back.  I'd sit at the bar.  \\n\\nI love the location.  Center of L5P.  In the evening it's kind of dead outside but in the afternoon the foot traffic outside offers amazing people-watching--the energy is just unbelievable compared to 90% of Atlanta patios which just look out to a freaking parking lot or street with cars and no pedestrian.

I did try the tots and didn't love them, they had a really heavy grease taste.

No, let me say it again, I really really heart Flour. I heart Joanne Chang, her recipes, her vision, her aesthetics. She has essentially introduced an amazing bakery with fresh, flavorful salads, soups, and sandwiches on house-made bread to many parts of Boston at very affordable price points. The coffee and tea are also superb. My old roommate got me a chocolate mousse from Flour last year for my birthday and it was divine. A thin chocolate layer gently tapped to reveal whipped heaven on the tongue. My workplace occasionally orders cakes from Flour and they are perfect, not overly sweet, moist, and with a generous array of fresh fruit. Due to being at a conference in the area, I had the pleasure of returning to this Flour location for lunch today. The tofu quinoa salad with spinach, little portabella bits, sweet diced celery (marinated?), with edamame and a fresh ginger-miso dressing, totally hit the spot, and half a lamb sandwich (simple joy, with great house made bread, chewy and substantive, red and green greens, a tomato sauce, lamb, and goat cheese) did not fail to disappoint. \\n\\nWhat I love most about Flour is how it fills a much-needed niche in Boston; a real bakery with memorable goods in many of the key Boston niches. Who can compare? Unlike NYC, bursting with myriad options, Boston has been anticipating a fine American bakery-for-the-people for a long time. One could argue -- there is Finale (which also eats your wallet), there are possibly specialty bakeries worth mentioning (yes, you could splurge), there are ethnic bakeries in the North End and Chinatown -- but for the approximately $5 and under for amazingness, excellent American staples with unpretentious flair, look no further. Your kid needs milk and a cookie? Done. Your inner kid needs milk and a cookie? Done. Flour represents what I would love to do for a community somewhere down the line of my 100-point bucket list -- fill a much-needed niche bringing good food to good people at an affordable price point. The place is hella busy -- no lack of bustling at a crowded lunch hour -- but its execution still prevails. Its staffers appear friendly, and business gets done! Dare I say that unlike Clover, which was also founded by a hybrid well-educated food-loving-person-who-also-does-another-trade (whose establishment and new ambitions to sprawl across the country are admirable), which achieves its \\"fresh fast food\\" mantra, I feel that Flour's quality exceeds Clover's in quality and uniqueness.

After reading about it, I hoped it was a place that succeed on all levels. It did not, but I'm not ready to write it of yet. In fact, in the ways that it failed, its service made amends, which makes me wonder if maybe the establishment is just in its early-jitters stage.\\n\\nUpon arriving a little late for a birthday celebration, I found that we were not, in fact, allowed to sit down.

Lucky for Porter, none of us had any other plans for the evening. Had their been any sort of schedule (say, if we were going to go to a show or another bar later or anywhere at all), this would've been a big problem. But my friend did have to talk to a manager and multiple staff members before we were even sat.\\n\\nOnce we had our table (granted, there were about 10 of us), the staff was very kind and attentive. They even bought us a round of appetizers, which, as far as I'm concerned, makes up for the previous problems. The beer was great and the selection strong.

The apps were great, especially the salt and vinegar popcorn and the cheesy/bacon-y hush puppies.\\n\\nAnother small gripe: Yes, the Brick Store is wonderful and many who come to Porter will be fans of Decatur's fine beer establishment.

These are tiny complaints, but they're also shameless copies, as anyone who's been to both places will realize.\\n\\nAll this being said, the bar is only barely open.

All the meats were tasty and super tender, although the pork belly and pulled pork were pretty fatty cuts. \\n\\nThis was one of the few places that serve Asahi and Sapporo on draft so I got a glass of cold Asahi that complemented the ramen very well."},{"name":"Terramia Ristorante","address":"98 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Best Italian in the north end.

We intended on going to Pomodora next door to Giacomo's but the wait seemed endless and the restaurant never seemed to open.  I think hours of operation are more suggested than anything.  The line for Giacomo's was long but steadily moving and so we decided to give it a shot.  How can that many people waiting for a meal be wrong and in fact they were not.  Our wait was relatively short given we stood outside Pomodoro's for over 45 minutes hoping they would eventually open. Now this restaurant is tiny but that adds to the ambiance and I was impressed with the friendliness of our waiter explaining the sauces and menu items.  he was hustling and food was coming out of the kitchen at a fast pace.  We ordered the calamari which was a very nice beginning to our meal.  I ordered the veal marsala and my niece the mussels fra diavlo.  The only qualm was the marsala sauce had a bit of a maple syrupy tatse which was odd and unfamiliar to me.

Since we don't come to this part of town a whole lot I pulled up my bookmark list and my wife was in the mood for Indian food. Aashiward Indian Restaurant came up and several people I know gave it some good reviews. When we arrived, the place had just opened and we were the first to arrive. My wife went to wash up and I sat down to wait my turn. I immediately noticed that the plate in front of me was not clean and inspected my wife's plate only to find it was also dirty. The waiter and my wife arrived at the same time and I said to my wife...  Let's go! \\n\\nOn our way in I noticed Pio Pio and I had recently bookmarked it because I love South American cuisine. We just walked in and only two tables were empty and we filled one and another couple that walked in behind us took the other. The smell of the food was intoxicating and I was excited. As I looked around I saw plate after plate of Peruvian and Columbian food hit the table and I was really excited to be here.\\n\\nOur server came over and introduced himself after about 10 minutes which was a bit long but I rolled with it. I asked him what he recommended and some of his responses made me just shake my head in disbelief. Instead of letting me know what was popular, he was letting us know only what he liked personally and talked down the red snapper which is one of my favorite things. As usual I ordered my unsweetened iced tea with lime and my wife wanted a glass of water. I was never told if there was a special of the day and to be blunt was afraid to ask. My wife ordered the Ceviche Peruano Mixto. This was a mixture of shrimp and white fish, citrus juice, garlic, onion cilantro and ricoto pepper. It comes with Peruvian fried corn and sweet potato. I ordered the Red Snapper and it came with tostones, fried Yucca and a house salad.\\n\\nThe salad came up very fast and I was pleased but the salad was just a salad with what tasted like an Italian dressing of some kind. Before I even took my first bite of salad, my wife's entr√©e arrived and we were a little thrown off by that. I started on my salad and after my second bite, my entr√©e arrived. I was a little annoyed that our meal hit the table in pieces and what was worse was I had to ask the server what the sauces he placed in the middle of the table were for since he neglected to tell us something as basic as that. The young man did not score points with me for customer service. \\n\\nOK let's get past the negatives and on to the food itself. EVERYTHING on my wife's plate just WOWED me! MY plate was equally impressive. Usually I get long winded about how each thing tastes but there is NO POINT in this case. BOTH of our entrees were FANTASTIC in every way possible. The manager Faunier, came over to check on our table and I let him know how the food was \\"Off the chain\\" BUT then I let him know where our server pretty much dropped the ball on his customer service skills. Faunier did not get defensive in any way but just stepped right up and took over for our server for the most part. My wife noticed that he pulled our server to the side and after that started waiting on the table to the right of us and there was a noticeable difference in the way he dealt with that table. It looked like he was now stepping up his game.\\n\\nWhen Faunier returned we inquired about the desserts offered and there was Guava and Mango cheesecake to choose from. Hey...  Why not get both! My wife had never tried Guava before but was a lover of Mango. When these cheesecakes arrived they were beautiful but I have to admit...  That was by far the best Guava cheesecake I have ever had. The Mango cheesecake was very good as well BUT I will be coming back for more of that Guava cheesecake in the future...  BET ON IT! \\n\\nNormally I would be unforgiving for bad service BUT in this case the manager came to the rescue, motivated our server to step up his game and was kind enough to only charge us for one of the cheesecakes. He did not have to do that but I did appreciate it and it shows that he really takes customer service VERY seriously. That scored points with me BIG TIME! I can say this with confidence...  I will be returning to try the half chicken that I saw several of the others order because it looked and smelled incredible. The table to my left and right both had it and raved about it.\\n\\nI usually take pictures of each restaurant but because it was PACKED, I elected to just take pics of the outside and the food.

I specifically requested a table in the main bar and was told I would get it.  Upon arrival, I was sat at a different, smaller tap table that could not fit my group.  They claimed that the group currently at my reserved table decided to stay for a second game.  As if a reservation means nothing.  So, we had no choice but to split our group of 12 into three tables.  I specifically requested a game 2 days prior and was willing to find another bar if they were not going to play our game.  They guaranteed me that we could watch it.  We watched it for all of 45 minutes until the TV was turned to a different game.  Management was involved, and their response was that all of the TV's are automatic and there was nothing they could do.  He even used the phrase \\"it is what it is\\"  What kind of a sports bar does that?  If we would have be told that we couldn't watch our game in full, then we would have gone elsewhere.  During the 45 minute game, one of our taps ran out of beer and could not be replaced because they were \\"out of beer\\".  We also witnessed the ounce meter on the tap increase without anyone removing beer.  The food menu had basically 3 things on it and were charging 15 dollars for a McDonald's level quality hamburger with no sides.

While I'll admit it is on the pricier side, it is completely worth the experience. I went with a friend and we sat at the chef's counter--it was so much fun getting to sit back, watch the open kitchen and be served dishes based on the chef's recommendations. The only thing I regret is not doing the wine pairing with the tasting (if you're going to spend the money, why not have a full experience, right?). Instead, we got a few cocktails, my favorite of which was the Civilian (a little spicy, touch of sweetness, perfectly balanced). Also really loved Ulises Abroad. \\n\\nEnvironment is homey and welcoming.

BOB is no longer in the market, Ben's Brown Bag closed earlier this year as well, and it looks that several other businesses are leaving quickly. Not sure if that is a tell-tale sign for something happening. There is a sign on the front of the market that a new pizza place is slated to open, Old Fourth Ward Pizza, but I don't know much else. \\n\\nThe crown jewel of the market is Jake's by and large. Their ice cream is great and they just moved into what was the space for BOB. It looks much more homogenized and more of a proper ice cream shop. I hope they do well. They are a fantastic local brand. \\n\\nThe biggest downside to the market is the structural aspect and the decor. The place is just pretty junky.

It wasn't my first choice or even my second. By process of busy elimination, we ended up here. \\n\\nThe interior is nice, rather upscale. They were very busy but after being told the wait for 2 was 25-30 minutes by one hostess, an unprovoked manager stepped in and could seat us right away. \\n\\nThe tables were comfy, great dim lighting and unfortunately close together. But being busy and rather small didn't impact our dinner either way. \\n\\nThe waiter approached and was very cordial and attractive. Before placing the drink orders, I asked him to place an order of steamed mussels for us. My date ordered a beer, as I decided on a \\"fun\\" fruity martini. \\n\\nAs the drinks were served my date ordered the duck breast and I opted for a steak, medium well. \\n\\nMy \\"fun\\" fruity martini was quite good then went with a glass of white wine. The mussels arrive and were delicious. The broth was VERY good. We asked two other staff members for bread twice since we hadn't seen our waiter. Another downside - one (small) piece of delicious and crunchy seasoned bread accompanied the mussels. \\n\\nWe were convinced our waiter at this point had disappeared. The runner finally cleared our plates after he served our food.\\n\\nAt first glance, my steak was buried by a small plate of greens but my date's dish looked delicious. I start to notice how small my entree was and barely saw any garlic mashed potatoes - what I really was looking forward to! I get offered a bite coyly by my date as I was cutting into my steak. His duck was pretty delicious. I then take a bite of my steak - and to my surprise - the top of it tasted like charred charcoal. It was burnt on the outside and was probably well done on the inside. \\n\\nTo avoid complaining, I opted to continue eating. Maybe because our waiter vanished, or because I was hungry. Not sure. \\n\\nI think our entire meal took us about ten minutes to finish. I remember joking with my date saying that I was glad we had an appetizer. We both would have left hungry. \\n\\nThe waiter appears, clears our plates and offers us dessert or coffee. I thought \\"how about an explanation for your 20 minute disappearance?\\" Instead, we politely decline and he then takes his time dropping the check. We waited. And waited. \\n\\nWe decided to split the check and had our credit cards waiting on the table. He drops the check and tell him to run the cards without looking at the check. I don't know about you, but when I go out to dinner on a date, splitting the check or not, I'm sure as hell NOT afraid of spending money OR seeing the check when it's time to pay...am I crazy? Normal? Not sure. THIS is the part that will prevent me from going to this establishment again. The waiter actually says to us: \\"Oh, too afraid to see the check?\\" (Laughs) and says he'll be right back. \\n\\nI'm not sure if he somehow understood us a jokesters or was generally a prick.

I was forced to put a minimum of 1 star in order to post.    I agree with some of the reviews on here.  My friend had purchased a $30 Groupon to try out the place.  We ordered 4 things, Chicken piccatta, Lobster Ravioli, Caprese salad, and 1 cappuccino.   At the end when we wanted to pay we showed them the groupon coupon and they said we couldn't use it towards lunch, when there were no fine prints anywhere that say we cannot use it for lunch.  Instead they said that they would have to charge us dinner prices in order for us to use that coupon.  A. The portion was a lunch portion and B. They should have honored the coupon to us when clearly there were no fine prints about not being able to use it for lunch!  Anyhow, my friend was nice and said no problem and to go ahead and charge us dinner price.  So the bill came back as $56 for the 4 things we ordered.  Again, they were chicken piccatta, lobster ravioli, caprese, and a cappuccino!  So with the $30 Groupon, the whole thing ended up being $26.  Let me just say that the meal was not worth $26.  The pasta for the chicken piccatta was under cooked, the tomatoes for the caprese wasn't even sliced thin.  They gave us 1/4 wedges as tomatoes.  Honestly, we basically ended up paying the usual lunch price.  We should have just torn up the $30 Groupon and probably gotten a better deal!  He must think we're stupid and can't do math!  From a business stand point.  The purpose of the Groupon is to get people to try out your restaurant and feel good about it and hopefully return.  Well, we're definitely not going back.

The waitress runs down how the menu is set up but you choose a sauce for the pasta they offered (lots of seafood stuff, mussles, lobster etc) I decided on a half lobster with mussels and clams over linguine with a fra diablo sauce (it is a red sauce, that is spicy and made with lobster base), this was out of this world, pasta was freshly made, and sauce was spicy and hearty, and lobster was cooked perfectly, and to top it off, the serving size was huge!!

We arrived on time and were told that the retaurant was running behind -- could we please wait in the lounge.  No one showed us where it was and at 7 months pregnant, we mostly stood in the lounge until 8:40pm.   We couldnt believe it was taking so long when we had a reservation that my husband had to check in on our table at 830.\\nWe were finally seated at 840 and our waiter Ben seemed well informed and explained the menu pretty well and our hopes went up...\\nWe never got any bread or butter on our table.  When we finally got our drinks my husband took a sip of his Sapphire and Tonic and it was flat.  He felt bad but since drinks are something like $13 a pop there I told him to politely send it back.  He did and I hear Ben mutter -- the tonic water is from a bottle it shouldnt be flat.  Well it was and drink #2 was flat also and my husband just sucked it up and drank it.\\nStill no bread and Ben was too busy to ask.\\nWe got the Barbeque Shrimp for an app and it was excellent.  The crab cakes were also quite good though my husband didnt think it was worth $20.  Finally we wait several minutes before anything is cleared or my husband can order another drink and we ask for the bread.\\nI normally get filet medium Rare but being pregnant I asked for it Medium.  We wait and wait and finally the food comes out.\\nBen leaves.  I sliced into my steak and its rare.  We are waiting for someone to check on us to take it away --- so I eat the potatos au gratin and green beans and just look at my steak.  Finally Ben checks in and I send the steak back.  He apologizes but at this point my husband is eating his steak and I have to eat sides without my steak and by the time it comes out -- He's almost done with his meal and I am done with sides.  A huge disappointment when you are paying $50 and $40 for your steaks.  I have to say this would never happen at Capital Grill because they wait on you hand and foot and have multiple people watching your table.\\nThe food is finished -- we're bummed out.  but I am at least excited for dessert.  Ben says he wants to give us one on the house for our anniversary.   Thats all well and good but after waiting 40 minutes to be seated with no apology and having eveything timed out wrong a free dessert is little consolation.  We order a coffee drink and a cappuccino and dessert.  We wait and wait.  the coffees come without the dessert.  We wait.

In this case, too many hosts muddle(d) the service and my critical first impression of Stats. We were initially greeted by an amiable host but he wasn't very knowledgeable (didn't know the ins and outs of the seating of the tap tables and the rooftop deck), but what he lacked in Stats knowledge and experience he made up for with a positive attitude and eagerness. The second host brought a cold and self-important austerity to our second first impression of Stats - hrm, 95% confidence (interval). With one of the signature draws being the at table-do-it-yourself-beer-taps, we were surprised that on 8PM on an warm, summer Monday night, with an empty bar we were derisively informed \\"your party is too small to sit at THOSE tables, we reserve those for parties larger than, well, yours\\" Sound logic in theory, but the place was empty and I didn't anticipate a large Monday night rush with no sports on beyond ESPN. We ended up sitting upstairs on the neat rooftop deck that overlooks the Marrietta district downtown. \\n\\nRelegated to the roof, begrudgingly, we order drinks:   A Braves Blue Lemonade and a certain \\"only in Atlanta\\" Sweetwater 420 beer but that beer can't be ordered upstairs from the rooftop bar so we schleped back down the steps to the bar to order a beer. Error bar (very applicable statistics principle)! \\n\\nMuch like my two graduate level statistics courses, at this point, I just wanted to eat and get out there (with a B- no less). For starters we ordered the spring rolls which to my surprise were the non-fried spring rolls wrapped in moistened rice paper sitting in a drizzle of a peanut sauce. Non fried in the south?! WHAAAT - SCORE, especially for this health conscious California girl! For dinner we went with the budget friendly ($5), heart healthy bowl of chili that's on the appetizer menu. It was a rather generous portion, especially for an appetizer and for $5 in addition to being the heart healthy option it was delicious. In addition, we ordered the fish (grilled mahi) tacos in flour tortillas with black beans and white rice. The well seasoned fish could have been cut into small(er) pieces - they put the whole fillet in the soft taco making for messy bites. \\n\\nStat's food is a step above, above the lows standard nines, greasy, uninspired bar food featuring an original menu that incorporates traditional comfort foods, southern charm in addition to a few heart healthy options and international dishes like the fresh spring rolls. I never fully recovered, attitude wise from that initial first impression, not enough to make the food speak for itself although it screams wonderful, tasty volumes. Upon exiting I saw that all of the at table tap tables were empty, Regression analysis - we'd spent considerably less money on alcohol than if we would have been able to sit at one of THOSE tables.\\n\\nHere's a maths problem for you - so see that statistically speaking restaurants typically make 30% of their revenue in bar and alcohol sales - how much more revenue would Stats have made if their self-important host would just have used a little situational awareness and demographic common sense to give the customers what they want? \\n\\n3.5 out of 5 stars. \\n\\nStatistics can be made to prove anything - even the truth.  ~Author Unknown"},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"3435 SW Cedar Hills Blvd, Ste A","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"Tomato soup in a bread bowl (when you are sick) is a life saver :).\\nTheir Whole Chipotle Chicken Avocado Melt is awesome (online orders are easy to customize: we added basil).\\nHalf Spicy Thai Salad with Chicken is really good as well (again can be customized as much you want).\\nFast service."},{"name":"Little Bangkok","address":"2225 Cheshire Bridge Rd Ne","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So, I've heard of this place for 3 years now, but could never score a parking spot in the front, so we always drove right on by.

That sight alone still makes my mouth water.\\n\\nAh yes, the pizza. So these are relatively large, thin, rustic Napolean (read: Southern Italian) styled pizza. Yeah, the pizza's are about $20 each. BUT, the ingredients are superb, the pizza is well made, and most importantly; delicious.\\n\\nOh, don't miss out on the little condiments bar near where they make the pizzas.

We tried a few places and was pretty disappointed each time.  Several people suggested Antico's and we were like, really? Is this place that good?  We looked at the reviews and they were all consistently highly rated out of several hundred reviewers.  \\n\\nThe first time we went there, the place was packed - so packed that we ended up bringing our pizza back home.  We were starving and it smelled extremely good and I kid you not, we devoured a whole pie in less than 9-11 minutes.  Whoa!  \\n\\nNow, they are a little pricey - $25 for a pie and they only allow you to put one topping per pie (no exceptions) at $5 per topping but our pizza to go, ordered on the spot, was out in less than 10 minutes - freshly made.  They have a community dining room set up and parking is a bit rough because of all the people waiting to get in.  The owner came out and said - 'You eating here right? - just park in the employee lot - don't worry about it'.  \\n\\nI had to ask - 'You sound like a New Yorker'.  'Brooklyn'.  That's a good sign.  We parked and waited on line for about 15 minutes and were on our way.  \\n\\nThis pizza was worth the wait, worth the price, and was so good, we wil not go anywhere else.  Three weeks later, we decided to head back over there with some friends on a Sunday.  Fail!!! They are closed on Sundays.  Seriously?  If you are a pizza joint and don't open on Sundays - even during football season - then you are making enough money during the week that giving your employees the day off is more important than making even more.  Or they take enough business during the week that they decided to give Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, all within a 3 block radius the chance to take some business at least one day out of the week.  Even with a 30 - 45 minute wait consistently, the other national pizza joints, with all the promotional prices they are pushing, and all the commercials they are paying for, these other guys are hearing crickets for 6 days out of the week.  \\n\\nAntico's is the place to go and we will not go anywhere else."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Crispy pig head, crispy pig tails.

An hour later (1 hr and 7 minutes to be precise) I go up again because we haven't been seated and then they say oh, someone is clearing off your table now. This took another 10 minutes or so. Finally we are seated. So show up at 7 (this place takes no call ahead reservations) and seated by 9:30. We only had four people too. \\n\\nWe were seated outside and not by a heat lamp, so it was a little cold. Additionally, the table we were offered was a bit awkward.

There were plenty of opportunities to serve more drinks but no one ever showed up to ask or suggest more to the eagerly thirstful group.

The fireplace should have been lit; especially with snow outside and all of the people inside looking for romance on their date night.  A bit noisey downstairs and hard to hear the lackluster singer performing.  I'd scratch the live performance for some good olde fashion back in the day music on repeat from an iPod.  I would move upstairs if noise is an issue, still with due caution because service might be worse with the extra flight.  Still, I would suggest this place for a decent night out but don't be surprised if there are dissappointments.  This was a real experience.

First, there are the people who are so excited to see what all the hype is about at Giacomo's that they almost pee their pants waiting in line for approximately 1-1.5 hrs on a Sunday at 4 pm. Then there are the over-worked workers who are trying to serve as many people as possible while maintaining some semblance of order on a Sunday at 4 pm. \\n\\nThe combination of the two is not pretty. You're squished next to someone who talks about their stalker ex-boyfriend (not even kidding here) while pulling your chair in every 2 seconds to let the waitress or someone who needs to use the restroom through, until you've semi-permanently lodged yourself between table and chair you might as well be one. Neither pleasant nor comfortable.\\n\\nTo be fair, the food was fine. Like I had said about the Giacomo's in South End, it's nothing spectacular, although admittedly the food was much better here than at the South End location.

In a general move of awesome they give me a bit of tasty soup to slurp down while I wait.  Then I head home with a bag full of food under my arm.\\nIt's a nice little mini spread and almost every thing is standard Chinese fare that could be cooked just a touch longer to make it a bit better.  The rangoons are a little chewy and could have been fried just a little longer, General Gau's is a touch soft and the beef teriyaki is missing the nice char that I like on the outside.  The only one that's really odd is the pork satay that has a thin satay sauce with little flavor and perhaps mistakenly got a chili pepper next to it on the menu (this is not a hot dish), it is still ok even though not what I was expecting.  Very importantly in the bag there are two fortune cookies, meaning that they properly followed the math of people you think the meal is for +1 something no self respecting chinese restaurant should get wrong.\\nSo I'm fed I'm happy and there's nothing horribly wrong with any of the dishes.  I trust the food a little more than I trust the food from China Delight (though you can't hang around and down a scorpion bowl) and it's closer than Wok and Roll.  Some nice bonuses are that their combo plates are well done because you get to chose the apps that you get with them and they have small sizes of a number of their dishes so if you want to try a crazy selection of stuff it's not going to be super expensive.\\nThis bodes well and with luck the food will only get better."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Very cozy and beautiful.

I don't think anyone who has ever been there after 6 p.m. can argue that. If you've only been for lunch, it's like, pardon the pun, night vs. day. The night scene is a bit insane for regular Joes and can instantly turn off anyone who just wants to enjoy a good meal. I haven't tried it for lunch ... maybe that's the bigger problem.\\n\\nThe margaritas, including the one we ordered hopefully with our favorite tequila, are predictably watery and underwhelming, especially for these prices. The food is a mix of predictable American Tex Mex and traditional Mexican, but, again, with hefty prices. Yes, you'll pay $$ for the chips and salsa (which is actually pico de gallo). I'd recommend instead of just the chips and salsa the Tres Amigos, which is chips with three salsas, at $6. The salsas with this one are actually salsa, and not pico de gallo, and worth it if you're going to go ahead and spend $$ on what is usually free salsa. Some of the entrees are relatively decent, though I'd only truly recommend the fresh guacamole and the tacos a la carte. The tacos (Note: I mean only the a la carte tacos, NOT the combination platters) are the only reasonably priced items on the menu. The \\"salad\\" and mass-produced rice with the platters are absolutely not worth the price markup. As a hardcore foodie, it was stunning to see that they serve incredibly underwhelming and stale elotes (Mexican corn on the cob) and call it esquites (warm Mexican corn salad). And, as tequila goes, they sell some fine ones right alongside some that aren't 100% agave, and they don't explain the difference to novices who will likely spend untold $$$ on oro (not true tequila).\\n\\nMost of the American staff doesn't know enough about traditional Mexican to answer a foodie's questions, especially about the tequila, so we'll probably request one waitress in particular if we go back, as she's from the Jalisco area and very knowledgeable and helpful with pretty much everything on the menu. \\n\\nA swinging singles 30-something crowd packs the place nightly, and the atmosphere and staff border on pretentious. Hostesses who are rather clueless and inexperienced are also the most pretentious, bordering on rude. Another reviewer's comment that where you sit has to be voted on and approved by all five of them made me laugh -- that's pretty accurate, bizarre as it is. The whole staff seems to be pretty inexperienced, but that's to be expected and you can only hope they get better. With the DJ spinning most nights, evening dining is as loud and crowded as it gets. Unbearable if it's not your kind of scene. \\n\\nLike most places on Sand Lake, this is food and alcohol for the masses. And the masses don't care whether it's authentic or authentically good. If you know and appreciate authentic Mexican, including what you know you would get if they were Certified Tequila Ambassadors/purveyors, it's a \\"take it or leave it\\" kind of choice here. As other reviewers have said, you can find more authentic, far more pleasing Mexican elsewhere in Orlando.

I mean, Islands of Adventures seemed huge compared to the older Universal Studios.  We came right when the park opened at eight, and easily could have done all the rides by noon if we hadn't decided to go back to our hotel and sleep for a few hours.\\n\\nATTRACTIONS\\nRevenge of the Mummy: I loved The Mummy and everything Ancient Egypt, so I was looking forward to this roller coaster.  I'm a little disappointed with how much of it was dark - it's much more fun to see stuff when you go whizzing around - but the set decoration I did see was pretty freakin' cool.  I did get jostled around a *lot*, so so the motion sickness prone might want to pass.\\n\\nDisaster: Anything involving Christopher Walken - I'm sorry, Frank Kincaid - is going to be awesome.  It's a little slow getting started, since an employee has to pick several actors from the crowd and take shots of them for the final \\"movie\\" trailer, but once you get into the subway it's a fun ride.  I mean, you got earthquakes, fire, and flood - all the disaster you could want, right?\\n\\nJaws: We hemmed and hawed about going on this ride because we didn't want to get wet.  (It was an unusually cold December morning.)  Finally we did, and naturally my butt got *soaked*.  It's a decent ride, about on par with Disney's Jungle Cruise in terms of thrills.  I thought it could have used a lot more shark.\\n\\nMen in Black Alien Attack: This must have been so cool when the ride first opened, but now it's a little worn down.  The guns aren't very accurate; you can't really tell if you're hitting the aliens or not!  You get spun around a lot, so again, this ride might be problematic for those who get sick easily.  I do think it's really cool that your score effects the outcome of the ride. \\n\\nThe Simpsons Ride: As sad as I am that there's no Back to the Future ride, I'm glad this ride is at Universal Studios because it's the best one they have, hands down.  The queue is very long, but entertaining because you watch a loop of Simpson animation (I'd guess it's between 30-40 minutes long) and once you get closer to the ride, the characters start interacting with each other.  The simulator takes you all over Krustyland, including several rides like \\"Captain Dinosaur's Pirate Rip Off.\\"  How can you not enjoy that?  There's a whole story behind the ride, too.  Really, really fun - it may not be thrilling, but you will laugh your ass off.  Go here first thing in the morning if you want to avoid waiting hours.\\n\\n Twister: For all the buildup for how devastating a real storm is - and the scary footage they show as you wait in the queue - this is a pretty tame ride.  More of a show, really.  You might get slightly wet from simulated rain, but it's definitely not a major draw to the park.\\n\\nThose are all the rides we did, so I can't comment on ET or the Nickelodeon attractions.  \\n\\n--\\n\\nThe only show we saw was UNIVERSAL'S HORROR MAKE-UP SHOW, which was not quite what I expected.  I thought it'd be something like a tutorial for how to make your face look like Frankenstein or the Wolfman - not so much!  It's much more entertaining.  You see film clips that showcase the evolution of movie make-up and two actors pretend to cut off limbs and ham it up for the kids.\\n\\nOh, I guess TERMINATOR 2 counts as a show, too.  This was cutting edge 3D when it was added to the park, but now that you can get 3D in almost any movie theater it's a lot less exciting.  See it if you're a Terminator fan; skip it otherwise.\\n\\n--\\n\\nWhile we were there, a section of the park was set aside for Christmas-themed vendors.  There were artisans selling their wares and a couple of food carts.  I only mention this because one food stall had DEEP FRIED OREOS, and they were fantastic.   \\n\\nOtherwise, the food wasn't too exciting.  We ended up getting Starbucks for breakfast, and the rest of the park's food was so underwhelming we just left and went back out to City Walk to find some grub.\\n\\n--\\n\\nPerhaps I would have enjoyed the park more if we hadn't gone to Islands of Adventure the day before.  But considering the entry price is the same, no matter which Universal park you go to, I felt like you got seriously less bang for your buck at Universal Studios."},{"name":"Circa 1926","address":"358 N Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3","text":"If you didn't know there's a quaint pub located behind the Park Ave. location of Circa 1926, now you do.

The waitress was impatient when we needed more time to order. My husband ordered the shrimp & scallops in a white garlic & cheese sauce. We began eating and after awhile, I noticed in the white sauce a dark object and asked him what it was. He scooped it out and it was a roach. We immediately called the owner over. He never said a word, just grabbed the dish and called for the waitress and gave her the dish. She said she will take it off the bill and is there something else he would like. At that point we couldn't or wouldn't eat anything from this place. After that they completely ignored us the owner never again looked our way or apologized. They wanted to act as if the incident never happened. I then told her I couldn't eat my meal she said she would take my dinner off the bill, but since my sons had just about eaten their meal we would have to pay for them. We never made a scene and paid for the two meals and left. The place is not relaxing at all, over crowded, noisy and the owner just runs around bumping into tables and other workers.

This place is seriously the best Thai food that I've had in and around Boston. I'm jelly-filled when I'm reminded that I live 30 minutes out. \\n\\nI had no expectations when we decided to come here for dinner after a trip to IKEA. We arrived around 7pm without reservations and were quoted a half hour wait. No big deal - it was only 31 degrees outside, but we waited. Diners came streaming out giving us props for waiting in such frigid conditions, but within 15 minutes the host popped his head out and told us that our table is ready. We were given a choice and opted to be seated beside the awesome fish tank opposite the waiting area. \\n\\nThe dining room is cozy, but airy with the super high ceilings above. Funky, bright paint colors and Thai art adorned the walls bringing it down to Earth. \\n\\nAs I made funny faces at the fish, completely oblivious to the patrons waiting for their tables on the other side, our waitress came by to take our order - \\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\n* Thai iced coffee for me - the New Englander in me doesn't give a shit how cold it is outside - and a frosty bottle of Chang for my boo. \\n\\nApps:\\n\\n* Grilled pork meatballs - grilled and glazed with three taste sauce (sweet chili sauce) served over a bed of watercress. It was okay. I expected homemade meatballs, but the texture made me believe they're of the frozen variety. We'll skip this one next time. \\n\\n* Som Tum (papaya salad) - one of the best I've ever had! The balance in the dressing is what all others strive for: sweet and spicy with a tang that lingers nicely. It was so fresh and the grilled shrimp was a nice touch! Perfect start to our meal. \\n\\nWe tend to eat family style at Asian establishments because it makes the experience that much more enjoyable. We knew we wanted fish, but wanted to supplement it with something from the land. They have an entire page dedicated to duck so we decided on one of those items:\\n\\n* Lime Leaf Duck - crispy half boneless duck smothered in Chef's special sauce and a side of steamed veggies. Very nice! The crispy, crunchy textures played nicely with the sweet and sticky sauce. The duck was ducky (I don't wan't to say unctuous, but it was) and wasn't overly fatty either. \\n\\n* Crispy Whole Red Snapper served Spicy Mango style - best dish of the night! It wasn't exactly a whole fish as they removed the entire back bone running down the middle of the fish thus making it easier to eat. It was essentially two large fillets with the head and tail still attached. It was deep fried to golden brown perfection and topped with shredded green mango and chilies. The tamarind sauce served on the side was delightful and hit all the right notes of sweet, sour and spice. It reminded me of my mom's whole fish with green mango slaw that I grew up on. So so good! \\n\\n* White rice - rice was white. Very rice!\\n\\nOverall, we had a great experience at Lime Leaf. The waitress was quick and attentive without being overbearing.

L.O.V.E.D loooooooooooooved it here.\\n\\nYes -- this is a historical hotel, full of quirks and lacking amenities such a television set and private bathrooms in all their rooms. But you know what? The latter is remedied by paying an extra $12 for a king suite (seriously people. Pay the extra moola if a private facility is worth it to you), and the former shouldn't be an issue for a traveler set on exploring the city.\\n\\nAs one may be able to guess -- I did pay that extra cash for a king suite and I absolutely ADORED our Sleater Kinney themed room. We had the largest room on the particular floor -- a gorgeous space in a corner room with windows that opened up to the city around us. I may have spent a good deal of time people watching from our 3rd floor perch. The bed is large, comfortable (but not luxuriously so), and peppered with so many pillows that a fort could have been made. Loved that.\\n\\nThe private bath was small -- but more than accommodating. Free shampoos, conditioners, and lotions all of excellent quality were available gratis, plus some pretty plush cotton  robes to lounge around in or throw over your swimsuit when you hit the basement salt pool.\\n\\nAnd that salt pool? Hot damn -- worth booking this Burnside gem for ~alone~. We utilized it as much as we could, I mean come on. Toasty temps, room to move and stretch out, plus having a cascade of that gorgeous salt water massage your back  was the best way to work out the kinks a Bolt Bus ride had given us. LOVED the salt pool, and surprisingly it was never busy the entire time we were there.\\n\\nAdded bonus -- this is a McMenamin's hotel. And while their beer lands in the \\"Ok\\" category of \\"not great but not bad\\", and extra $10 will give a couple 2 taster trays of all their available beers, plus a growler fill of their favorite to pack back home. We enjoyed their Ruby Pale, surprisingly appreciated the licorice-y-porter, and went home with a growler of malty rich stout.  A deal worth adding to your bill for sure.\\n\\nPrices are another reason to love this hotel. Even with the add ons of beer and king suite status, this was one of the cheaper hotels I could find in the area. Add on a pleasant staff, an in house restaurant, two bars, and being conveniently located kitty corner from the Crystal Ballroom and well.

Friday night was Tiger Mama, which was superb, Saturday night was Craigie on Main.\\n\\nCOM had received as much hype as I'd ever heard for a Boston restaurant, that said I try to take a formalist approach to culinary criticism. The idea is to experience the food as a complete standalone from the hype, expectations, chef, pricing strategy and even the atmosphere. I later take all that into consideration but at first I want to understand the food, the concept of each dish, the flavor profile, and the way it makes me feel. \\n\\nFirst plates were Pigs Tail, Chicken Leg Confit, Phytoplankton Radiatori and Octopus La Plancha. With the exception of the Chicken Leg, which was one of the poorest showings of the night, with more of porridge-like consistency than anything that would resemble confit, everything else was quite good. (Side note: the server described the Duck Leg as a big bowl of deliciousness, yet it was anything but that). The Phytoplankton was a particular standout. The incorporation of Asian influences into pseudo-Italian pasta dishes is a popular concept right now. Where restaurants like Basta Pasta in NYC fall short, Craigie nailed this one. The Pig's tail was also excellent, tasting like a more petite spare rib with greater complexity of flavor contributed by the pickled peanuts and sweet and sour sauce. Expectations after first plates were reasonably high. \\n\\nThen second plates were Prime Rib, Cavatelli, Scallops and Hake. \\nThe scallops were serviceable and lacked the textured crust you'd expect on the top and bottom from a dry scallop and searing hot pan. The sauce on the scallops was simplistic and unmemorable. The Prime Rib was incredibly rubbery and because the medium rare temperature looked to have been achieved by the color of the meat, I'd question the quality of this particular cut. The Cavatelli was perhaps the worst item on the menu, devoid of flavor and any kind of meaningful presentation. The hake was served with clams, both were overdone. \\n\\nNet net, the food alone was not at all impressive. There were certain dishes from the first plates like the Pig's Tail and Phytoplankton that did deliver but 2 dishes out of 8 does not make for a favorable experience. On the food alone I rate this restaurant 2 stars. \\n\\nNow factoring in the service, which surprisingly was a let down as you would think Saturday night means the \\"A\\" team, I rate this restaurant 1.5 stars. The staff really just appeared to be going through the motions. They were cordial and somewhat prompt, but their overall lack of knowledge and attention to detail was lacking. When I asked for clarification on two of the dishes I received mirror explanations to those I'd just read in the menu. When I ask for deeper insight I'd expect to hear more on the WHAT as it relates to flavor components, and for a really good waitstaff, I'd also expect to hear WHY a chef chooses to include a particular dish. Lastly on price, and I really don't think any price is too expensive for a superb experience, COM is pricing on reputation and hype. The service, food and overall experience fall way short. I'd be open to going back and trying the bar for the burger, but the main dining is inferior to any number of restaurants elsewhere in Boston."},{"name":"Totto Ramen","address":"169 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3","text":"Out of the three Brighton/Allston area Ramen shops that I've been to (Inaka and Pikaichi being the others) Totto is my favorite.

The broth wasn't out of this world good but was flavorful enough to keep me interested.  What stood out was the amount of meat that you get with the bowl that made the experience worthwhile, especially if you're a true carnivore.

So, I settled for...everything else. Brisket, sausage, pork ribs, turkey, chicken. You name it they 'cued it. And I ate it. And almost passed out.

Not sure if it's the fresh ingredients or unique combination of flavors, but this sandwich works!!!! And of course I tried the sticky bun but I was not as impressed. It was given to me at room temperature so maybe I had to ask them to warm it up; regardless, it was perfect in density and in sweetness but I wasn't so fond of the pecans on top.

We started with the soup and salad - the Chicken Tortilla Soup was good, but not better than Panera Bread's Chicken Tortilla Soup. The salad was doused in oil and the croutons were soft...because they've been soaked in oil. We each ordered the NY Strip steak - his with with the Au Poivre sauce, mine with a Blue Cheese crust. Both of these were INCREDIBLE. The Au Poivre sauce was 2nd only to the best Au Poivre sauce we had in Lisbon. The house red that I ordered to pair with my steak was faltering however - did not really go with my steak. For sides, we chose the Sweet Potatoes and the Mashed Potatoes. The Sweet Potatoes were AMAZING - but sweet to the point where it was like eating a dessert. Still highly recommended though. The mashed potatoes were incredibly average. Finally, for dessert, we were given the bread pudding as the only option, and it was mediocre. Overall, place had great ambiance, but very unimpressive food.

All of a sudden, my Dad and I take a turn down this random street and come across this place. Best decision we made because this place is just perfection.\\n\\nSo, the feel here is so unique and quaint but hip at the same time.  The huge chalkboard upon entering is loaded up with menu options.  Everything was mouth watering, literally.  Making a decision was super difficult and the combinations of ingredients were genius.  They had a special board as well.  We came in around 3 pm on a Friday thinking it would be quiet because it is on the later side of lunch.  They were crankin.  Long line and they meant business behind the counter. \\"Next, next, next.\\"  I won't lie it was a bit intimidating because I had a few questions about the sandwiches since I had never been here before.  Not sure if the gentleman who assisted us was the manager, cook, or perhaps both but he was a total sweetheart and didn't rush us at all!  I asked about the sandwiches and he said the only bread they served on was the white focaccia. I would have preferred a whole wheat option but what are you doing to do?  He described the sandwich and said if we had ANY doubts whatsoever and didn't like anything about the sandwich to let him know and he would happily replace it with something else.  Now THAT'S what I call customer service.  Turns out, the sandwiches were, well...I'll be dreaming about it until the next time I make it to Boston.  Seriously.\\n\\nMy Dad and I both went with the chicken breast, roasted red peppers, caramelized onion and brie sandwich.  The sandwich had arugula on it which wasn't listed in the description but it should be because it was the perfect addiction to the sandwich.  It was grilled, perfect size and not greasy or anything.  We left feeling satisfied but not full which was our intent.  The seating in here is interesting.  There are a bunch of high two tops along the sides, tables for two scattered throughout and then one dining room looking table on the side.  There definitely aren't enough seats for the volume they get, they should expand!!  We didn't indulge in any bakery items however they looked SO delicious.

Pasta specials like fettuccine bolognese, are outstanding. Its fresh pasta, and its cooked al dente, the way pasta is supposed to be cooked! Good luck finding a pickier pasta person than me. KEEP THE WHEAT PASTA OUT OF A REAL PLACE LIKE THIS. The baked pastas are very good as well, really nice touch coming out of the brick oven, with tasty, real tomatoes in the sauce. Pizzas are authentic and their sauce is mild as opposed to the overpowering salt fest you find in most pizza sauces, so you will taste the fresh dough and cheeses. The only thing I'd suggest is leaving flask of extra virgin olive oil, so we can drizzle some on top just after it comes out of the brick oven, just like the old country. All of their salads, including appetizer salads, are super green and fresh, and they give you plenty. As far as an appetizer, I'd put their meatball against any other in the city. These won't bounce. You can't squeeze them and watch them revert back to its original shape, so its the right mix of more meat and less breadcrumbs. Comes with greens and red peppers that along with the bread and olive oil, could be a light meal. Last but not least, the pork chop is the champ of the entree meats. Super thick, which allows them not to overcook it, and its its properly seasoned, so you can add the fresh ground pepper when  it comes around.

Order Nachos, chips and salsa, burgers, but DO NOT be tempted by the really ambitious menu.  I'll explain.  I am a HUGE fan of tuna... they offered Tuna Tataki, ordinarily a easy to prepare, very fine meal.  Only one thing is required: High Quality Tuna.  My Tataki was ICE COLD.  No problem, I like raw tuna.  Problem: this had been frozen.  I could tell because of the texture and wetness of the cold fish. Just skip it.  The tuna was presented on a salad, but the salad was just drenched in dressing...\\n\\nCharlie decided to go for the cheesesteak... and he was equally disappointed.  The meat, he said was stringy and really fatty.  Skip that one too.\\n\\nCharlie also has the Tomato Basil soup, and gave it props.

You can bring headphones, but you will likely blow three hours staring at the lake and wondering if all the people there have regular jobs.\\n\\nTheir espresso is the best. Their coffee is strong but not burnt or bitter. And I love when they've just ground some beans--you can smell it in the air. They also sell Rock Star bagels. I love to get the Sea Salt bagel with cream cheese, toasted.\\n\\nTheir desserts are pretty reputable, but I've only had the strawberry tres leches. Yum, tastes like strawberry shortcake. They have lots of little cakes and gelato too.\\n\\nParking close is luck-of-the-draw, but it's a short walk from the parking lot across the street (much longer if it's in the August heat).

We decided some Chinese food was better than no Chinese food, and warmth was much preferred to the cold, and so resolved to give up our search and duck into a place called DinHo.  \\n\\nThe restaurant was warm.  It smelled good.  Hot tea was immediately brought to the table.  Things were looking up!  \\n\\nAnd, surpise, we managed to find the right place after all!  It must be that internal Chinese food radar of ours.  Or Kuan Yin in her infinite mercy.  Or just plain dumb luck.  Don't let that DinHo sign fool you, this is indeed Frank Ma's.  \\n\\nI had my all-time favorite, hongshao qiezi (eggplant braised in soy sauce).  The texture was perfect- soft but not too mushy.  The sauce was great, too... not too salty, not too oily.  It didn't have the sweet undertone that the dish sometimes has, but the flavor was balanced and my taste buds were happy.  The egg and chive pancake was perfect, too.  The color contrast is amazing, and it's stuffed full of green goodness, rice noodles, and bits of scrambled egg.  \\n\\nBut it's not just the food that makes this place great.  It's the people!  Amy and our waitress made sure the teapot was never empty.  Frank the Friendly was greeting patrons left and right- what a popular guy!   We had a nice chat about Beijing (I spent a semester there 5 years ago), he grew up nearby.  He introduced one of his guest to me...I'm not sure why, but perhaps because a white girl speaking Chinese is an oddity, and most Chinese people are extraordinarly enthusiastic and complimentary at my attempts to master Mandarin.  \\n\\nWhen we finally finished eating, I didn't want to leave.  I felt like I could hang out there drinking tea all day, sampling the menu and watching Taiwanese news on the big screen TV.  Frank Ma's feels comfortable, familiar...like my grandma's house.

Then, later, the homemade pasta with ham and crab - wow-o. Unbelievable. Everything else came in after this in terms of impressiveness, though the pigs head stood out for the experience as much as the taste.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and attentive. The people working there are all pretty relaxed which I personally liked. It's fine dining, but it's not too formal. Also in the positive column, there were a couple of complimentary things sent out way during the evening. Thanks guys!\\n\\nSo given all this, why not 5?\\n\\nFor the price we paid - for two people, we dropped $400 with a bottle of wine - you have to manage to make everything AMAZING, not just a good part of it. I didn't think it was at that standard. None of the dishes were bad - don't get me wrong - it's just they all weren't 5 stars.\\n\\nBut the thing that got me the most was this, however: after selecting the \\"ultimate craigie experience\\" of 8 courses, the first words out of our waiter's mouth were \\"would you like to get the beef bone marrow as well? how about the mushrooms?\\". I didn't quite know what to say to that. We had just opted for an 8 course tasting menu - the \\"ultimate experience\\" - and now you're trying to upsell us? Clearly, it's not ultimate enough. Craigie: if you're going to put something like this on your menu, please put your best foot forward. We should not be asked if we want other things because they're \\"so good tonight\\" - they should simply be included. This extends to the pig's head pancakes, which again, we had to pay extra for. That is clearly part of the zeitgeist surrounding your restaurant, so include it in the ultimate tasting menu. If you have to increase the price, fine, but the way you're doing it at the moment feels like I'm being upsold at a cheap and less reputable institution.\\n\\nIn summary: it's good, but not good enough for the perfect 5 stars."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We pre-gamed at The Lower Depths before thurs nights sox game & I was pleasantly surprised by the food & beer selection.

Teppanyaki, is more of a circus act and for me their traditional Japanese menu is where it's at!  \\n\\nI've never once had a bad meal here.  The food and particularly the sushi  is always extremely fresh.  Nishi, the head sushi chef is a master.  The artistry in the cuts of sushi is just beautiful.  The quality of the fish is top notch.  \\n\\n- A must try is the churo Toro is just spectacular cut of tuna that literally melts in your mouth.  No soy sauce or wasabi is required.  Just enjoy the perfect pairing of rich fatty tuna and quality rice.\\n\\n- A must try is the hamachi collar.  It's an app or a small plate that comes with literally just the collar of a hamachi or yellowtail fish.  It's a glorious rich cut of the fish and it's slightly grilled.  It's hard to get to all of the meat using just the chopsticks...I just use my fingers, not kidding.\\n\\n- A must try is the Spicy Scottish Salmon roll.  It's a specialty roll in the seasonal section of the menu.  It's center is spicy salmon and avocado, wrapped with rice, then topped with melt in your mouth salmon.  It's also garnished with wasabi soaked roe.  It's not really that spicy, but rather rich and creamy.\\n\\nIf you feel like trying something other than the rice rolls.  All of the sashimi is absolutely fantastic.  I love the $30 sashimi platter because it's has white tuna, torro or fatty tuna, another type of deep red tuna, hamachi, amberjack, salmon, and several other types of fish that are so freaking good that I should remember them, but I forgot my ginko-biloba today.\\n\\nShabu Shabu is super fun and really yummy Japanese version of fondue.

I ordered their scallops with a white wine sauce. I was disappointed. The scallops had a heavy seafood odor to it, with a taste of not-so-fresh scallops or ones that weren't properly prepared. Most of my friends had a good experience with their selections. \\n\\nGiacomo always has a long line waiting outside the door. I've seen it snake around the corner, even in the blustering New England winter cold. \\n\\nMaybe I'll give them another chance in the future. Hopefully their food will taste fresher this time!"},{"name":"Chilli Duck Thai Cuisine","address":"829 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My favorite place for Thai food in Boston.

I've been coming to this specific Chipotle for the past 3 years and ever since I tried their burrito bowl with chicken, i've never had anything else. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of burritos themselves. But for some reason, once the contents are presented to me in bowl form, I'M IN LOVE.\\n\\nHere's the \\"recipe\\" for my routine bowl: Rice, grilled veggies, (no beans), chicken, mild salsa, a little medium salsa, corn, lettuce, a little cheese, and sometimes a dollop of guacamole (costs extra unfortunately). As an added touch, I like to squeeze some lemon juice on top (lemons are provided next to the utensils). It just feels like a healthy bowl of rice, veggies, chicken, and salsa- who can turn that down?\\n\\nAlso, one time I had to wait a little while longer because they just ran out of rice when it was my turn to order so I had to wait on a second batch. I started chatting with the guys working there, who are always really friendly, and then they gave me my bowl for free!!!! I probably waited like 3 minutes longer than usual. Not a bad trade off."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The pizza pricing is a bit above average, so I expected a bit above average tastes and textures.

What a nice surprise to find such a pizzeria in Atlanta. This definitely raises the standard.\\n\\nMy first bite said more to me than any human being could. It was like having a first date every time I bit into that pizza, which was totally large enough for at least 3 people. After two slices, I was stuffed... and I usually eat 3 at most pizzerias.\\n\\nThere has been some controversy over the employees being without legal documents and that really turns people away from what I hear, but Yelp is more about the quality of service and product than it is about politics.

Most recently, I biked here from German Village via the Scioto/Olentangy Trail. You can easily get here from the trail and avoid biking on any busy roads. Additionally, it's relatively close to Whetstone Park/Park of the Roses and other little antique shops and boutiques in Clintonville. Mozart's is a great stop if you're in the neighborhood for an entire morning or afternoon of exploring. \\n\\nI've never had dinner here, but the dinner menu looks enticing. I usually stop in for the rotating quiche-of-the-day. Who doesn't love a good, creative quiche? This last time I decided on the weiner schnitzel sandwich (afterall, I was biking). The veal was too tough, and my sandwich fell apart as I tried to gnaw through the meat. Shoulda stuck with the quiche. Still, the flavors in the breading on the veal and the texture of the bread were great. And, this is the first time I've had any complaints about the food.\\n\\nIt's been awhile since I purchased any bakery items, but one favorite thing to do is purchase a variety of petit fours (and marzipan peaches!) to take home to serve with an afternoon lunch party. Their cakes are a great pick if you're hosting a shower or throwing a small birthday party... not your usual chocolate/vanilla birthday cake blandness. Speaking of showers, one time I was here there was a baby shower being hosted in the back room. I think this would be great event space-- a homey vibe if throwing a soiree in your own home isn't an option.\\n\\nService has always been good, if a little slow. But, I'm not usually in a hurry if I'm here. \\n\\nI like that there are flyers posted about upcoming community events. Mozart's also seems to host its own little events (I think I recall a special \\"birthday menu\\" for Amadeus's birthday?). Add in the live piano, and every visit can feel a little bit like an \\"event.\\"\\n\\nThere are two things keeping me from giving Mozart's 5 stars: (1) the sometimes haphazard plating of the food and (2) the ambiance on the patio. As far as plating, Cambridge Tea House really knows what's up in terms of presentation. Mozart's could take some cues from them on simple ways to make the food as pleasing to the eye as it is to the tastebuds. I agree with Luke T.'s assessment that the patio leaves something to be desired, which is a shame for the prime location.

Well fear not, here you can get vegetarian versions of all the sushi rolls - Dragon Roll with veggie \\"eel\\", or tempura \\"shrimp\\" roll, or if you like cucumber, could still get the plain cucumber roll. Some of the rolls even have avocado rolled into the top of the sushi. The rice is well prepared too - fresh and just the right balance of stickiness and softness, much much higher quality than supermarket sushi.\\n\\nThe restaurant is owned and operated by a super nice Asian couple, so as with most family places, service is superb.

So wherever you have it, pack, bike, motor vehicle or helicopter, mind the wet spot, stay calm and bring a towel.\\n\\nCrakalacks is A-OK. The batter build on their chicken is righteous. I'm a fan of thicker crusts on fried chicken, rather than thinner. I had the hot (not mild, not extra hot, just right). It was spicy, salty, simple, and effective in flavor. \\n\\nI think any place that fries has some secret method to drain off the oils or absorb them into paper towels to trick us into thinking it healthy, but Crakalacks makes no pretense. Out of the fryer and hot into the sammy.  \\n\\nI had the Blazer with bacon. The bun, nothing special, but A-OK. Slaw just fine. The chicken breast was moist, precisely cooked. The pickles A-OK, the bacon, of great quality, hot spiced, and crisply cooked. \\n\\nWhy not 4 stars? The crust is salty and hot spiced, which is their concept, but would benefit from a more complex flavor profile to get more stars. On the other hand, it would be difficult for more complex flavors to taste through extra hot spices. So it's the fried version of extra hot wings, which certainly have their adherents, excluding me.\\n\\nReasonable price for the big size portion.

Nachos are about the layers, people. It doesn't take a genius. Chips, cheese, chips, cheese. It's not hard. The toppings are supposed to be toppings in name only. Also, the much-vaunted sweet potato fries? Were cold and unsalted. They also arrived at the same time as the meal, even though we asked to have them as an appetizer. Appetizer goes *before* the meal.

Whenever friends and I would debate where to go for Chinese, those in the know would lament, \\"I wish Frank Ma's was still open!\\" Well, their prayers have been answered. Steve Drucker, a former restaurateur responsible for such finds as Chef Liu and Tasty China, reported on Atlantacuisine.com, that Frank Ma's would be reopening a week ago. Ma fans around Atlanta could barely contain their excitement. \\n\\nI met Steve and some other friends for lunch yesterday--their first service since reopening. While I would not normally report on a restaurant's opening day, I am confident talking about this place because Frank and Amy Ma are no strangers to the restaurant business (I believe they have had about 5 restaurants in Atlanta). The super-friendly couple kept trying to retire, but they always get pulled back in to the business. As our dining companions filtered in, Frank greeted those he knew with big hugs and lots of chatter. One of our table members recalled Frank teaching him how to use chopsticks at 6 years old and another talked to Frank about his family with the kind of familiarity you just don't see much of these days. Through all of this, Frank had a massive smile on his face that never faded throughout our whole meal. It was all very endearing.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a Chinese buffet for lunch (which did not look half-bad), but we chose to order the Shanghainese and Taiwanese specialties off the menu. Actually, Steve did the ordering which I was more than happy to step away from since he knows the menu so well. As our dishes arrived, 5 pairs of chopsticks started darting around our table and the consensus was delicious. In between snapping photos (a task considering I was the only gal at a table full of very hungry men), I sampled the dishes. I am not lying when I said everything was delicious. I couldn't find fault with anything. \\n\\nThe Shanghai soup buns, probably one of my favorite things to eat in this world, were the first to arrive. I was so excited to have one that I didn't wait for the bowl and spoon required to eat one and just grabbed it with my. The paper-thin dumpling skins and flavorful filling were a welcome change to the frozen variety I've encountered around Atlanta lately. \\n\\nPan-fried pork dumplings were a new dish for me. The dumplings were linked together and I did not know what to expect when I bit inside. The filling was luscious and juicy ground pork so hot I had to pace myself. Just gorgeous. \\n\\nSliced fish in hot oil (the one dish I requested we order) was probably my favorite. The fish was confit-like and had the slightest hint of spice. Schezuan peppercorns maybe? This is a must order. Just make sure you place a little rice in your bowl to catch the juices from the fish. Stunning. \\n\\nThree-cup chicken was a new dish for me. I was expecting it to be salty, but the dish had a pleasant sweetness (without being cloying) and the pieces of chicken were caramelized and very tender. I also enjoyed the whole cloves of garlic, which I ate more than my share of. A must-order dish.\\n\\nThe Chinese broccoli was sliced into manageable pieces and just al dente enough. A little green among a see of dumplings and meat is always a nice contrast. \\n\\nSlices of pork belly stir-fried with leeks was another new dish for me. The soy-based sauce was silky and each slice of pork had the right amount of fat needed to make every bite a decadent dream for the pork love in you. \\n\\nThe onion pancake was expertly prepared. Flaky, light, and crisp. \\n\\nThe chive dumpling was another example fot he kitchen's excellent skills. A light skin filled with scrambled eggs, noodles, and bright bursts of chives. I couldn't get enough.\\n\\nVerdict: Frank Ma is back and I think I am already addicted. Get over there now.

The construction in the 50/436 intersection area has been brutal for their business, but they still prosper somehow. I feel that today, I betrayed them.\\n\\nI watched from a distance as the defunct Sobiks on 434 sloooowly transformed into Bite. I must admit that I mocked the concept initially. I mean, Sonic is right up the street and their weiners are...well, ok, adequate at best. Still, how could a hot dog be good enough to sustain an entire stand-alone location in a strange yet congested part of 434? \\n\\nOne bite and my questions were answered. I am a fool for mocking you, Bite Hot Dog Company. Oh, I got ahead of myself a bit...I did knock off a star for a big-time pet peeve of mine. I'm not saying you have to go overboard and obnoxiously scream \\"WELCOME TO BITE\\" or \\"BITE ME\\" or anything to that effect. However, when there are about 8 employees behind the counter and on the food prep line and I'm standing there in front of them...well, I don't think it's too demanding of me to expect that my presence would be acknowledged.\\n\\nStand silently, watch them communicate with each other. One girl behind the line is texting, of course. This is 2011. Finally, I get the warm welcome of \\"what can I get for you.\\" ALMOST enough to knock Bite down to three stars, but the frankfurters that followed saved that fourth star. \\n\\nAfter much deliberation, I got the Chicago Dog. They send one of yours to the hospital, you send one of theirs to the morgue. Wait, that's the Chicago Way. I got the Chicago Dog to compare it to Hot Dog Heaven. From regular, jumbo, or spicy, I chose spicy. It was every bit as good as Hot...Dog...Heaven's. I feel dirty admitting that. Throw in the fact that 434 is about 20 miles and 45 minutes closer to my house...and...oh, I can't even print it. I'm sorry, Hot Dog Heaven. I promise I'll visit you if I'm ever in that area.\\n\\nBonus BITE: one of the managers brought us a free basket of fries. I'm not much of a fry guy, but these were magnificent. My son is quite the fry fan and he loved them as well. I don't know why they did this, but I suspect it may have had to do with the fact that we ran into Magic President Otis Smith there. I've known Big O for years and he wouldn't let me pay for our lunch. He insisted on picking up the tab for me and my little dude...that is a class act, ladies and gents.

Literally, this is one of the best restaurants I've been to ever in the US. Like, I think this place should be in those top 100's in the US at the very least.\\n\\nWalked in here on a Saturday 2pm with two friends and their puppy, so we sat outside on the patio area listening to live music, and sadly didn't get all-you-can-eat BBQ for the $20/pp price. However, we did order up 1 pound of ribs, 1 pound of moist brisket (with some burn ends added in), 1/2 pound of turkey, medium sizes of all 3 sides (beans, slaw, potato salad), a loaf of bread, pickles and peppers, both the spicy and regular sauce, and some iced teas. All together was under $50, and the 3 of us left packed full, so it turned out to be a BETTER deal to buy food more than the all-you-can-eat.\\n\\nThe brisket was moist and tender, cooked so clearly slow from the taste. It was smokey, salty, fatty, and just melting in my mouth. \\n\\nBurnt Ends? My mouth is salivating right now, my stomach is convulsing. The Burnt Ends...deliciously fatty, almost heart stoppingly tender and juicy, crisp and crusty on the top....the most heart-attack enduring but glorious meat I've had ever.\\n\\nThe ribs? Fall off the bone. Literally I bit into one end and the rest of the meat just fell off the bone. Not overly smokey rib meat, but juicy and basted over and over again to the bbq-flavor. Honestly, I didn't even need the bbq sauce (even though the regular was sweet and smokey, and the spicy was just a bit spicy but not too over the top), given how juicy the meat was, dipping it was almost a bit of overkill for me.\\n\\nThe turkey was decent, unfortunately, I wish it was juicer. Good attempt though.\\n\\nThe sides were all delicious. The slaw is more like a light salad, no trace of heavy mayo at all, just shredded lettuce and a bit of celery seed, probably some light mayo. Pretty refreshing break when eating heavy bbq. The Potato Salad is to die for, they must make it with a bit of the bbq sauce because the potato salad is a bit smokey and definitely has a tang to it. The bean are just delicious, most likely because its cooked with the leftover bits of bbq meat, so its pretty freaking side-stickingly good. Loaf of bread? Meh, I'll pass next time. Jalape√±os? Didn't even touch them, they smelled like fire and might ruin my experience. Pickles and onions were delicious. \\n\\nOverall, freaking delicious BBQ. Middle of nowhere for sure.

It strangely came with fries, which didn't quite fit. There may have been other options to switch them with, but I was too hungry to notice. The fries were fine.\\n\\nHowever, my friend immediately deterred from the original plan of salad and got a plate full of meat which as a South American he was extremely excited about. He ordered the Bandeja Paisa. He was not disappointed! He was overjoyed with everything on his plate and I had to fight for a taste and was too late for some of the items - they disappeared quite quickly.\\n\\nHis plate had three types of meat, an arepa, fried plantains, a fried egg, some rice, and came with a bowl of beans. I'm typically ambivalent towards beans, but these were not normal beans. They were incredible. In fact, I have leftovers in my fridge now that I'm trying not to eat.\\n\\nHe loved his meal.

We stood at the front waiting to be seated for over 15 minutes. Once we were seated the waitress took another 20 minutes to actually come take our drink orders (after I had already attempted to order a drink, she walked away mid sentence for no reason). When she brings me my drink she spills it all over the table goes \\"oops\\" walks away and doesn't clean it up. We had no napkins so I couldn't clean it up, had to go track down the other waitress to get it cleaned up. When our appetizers arrived we didn't have any cutlery or napkins still and we politely asked for some. The waitress proceeded to sass us super hard as if what we were asking was extremely rude, she came back and threw them down on the table right in the center and rushed away again to do seemingly nothing in the empty restaurant.

Whether he was BSing or not (I don't know jack about wine) he sounded passionate about his recommendations and again, replaced the wine that wasn't a hit.

If they wanted to earn super points they would also offer the cinnamon kind, yum! Finally, if they really wanted to blow it out of the water they would do open face smores. 'What is this' you say? Well, I'm about to give away my million dollar idea. Instead of a wafer on top (which upon biting down on, smushes the top and bottom together and squeezes all the smore filling out the sides = lame) you could replace it with...wait for it....Teddy Grahams! For starters, this is adorable. But most importantly, it would allow you to keep the majority of the smore filling on top of the base cracker and still get graham on the bottom and top in each bite. Genius, I know. (For the record, the server dug my cinnamon idea, crossing my fingers this gets passed on, and/or they read Yelp)\\n\\nSimplicity's d√©cor lives up to its name.

I made the reservation a few months ago, since tonight was Valentine's Day. They were able to seat us all together at one long table, and I had pre-selected a price fixe menu for $65/person and it was honestly so worth it. It was actually priced in the mid-range compared to some other nice restaurants I was looking into (and when I was comparing menus and venues, it seemed like a much better value!). They were able to accommodate all of our group's dietary restrictions with ease (we had a few people who are lactose intolerant, vegan, or allergic to fish), and the vegan options looked amazing, like dishes I would be excited to order even as a meat lover! \\n\\nThe price fixe menus change seasonally, but I don't think you can go wrong with anything at Chambar. Their drinks were also amazing and excellent quality. I tried my friend's hard apple cider and a Belgian beer called \\"duchesse de bourgogne,\\" and they were both the best I'd ever had. I got a pineapple cocktail that was delicious also, not too sweet or syrupy.\\n\\nAll of the food was incredible!

I think the curry at Izakaya Syun in Hillsboro is better.\\n\\nSide note: if you want pretty good curry, check out Coco Ichibanya.

Mozart's is an exceptional coffee house in every way. I am primarily going to speak about their coffee in this review. I have had coffee all over the world, from the mountains of Ethiopia, to the cafes of Beirut. I know coffee, and I am very picky.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, they roast their own coffee on premises. This is VERY important to true coffee connoisseurs. By having freshly roasted coffee you avoid that bitter taste you often get at the majors chains. Note: some people may not think the coffee tastes strong enough because they are used to bitter tasting coffee served at chains. If your coffee is very bitter, you are having a bad cup of coffee, (I'm looking at you Pike Place Roast.) I usually will order the Cafe au Lait, which is steamed milk combined with drip coffee. They will actually give you free refills of the steamed milk with the Cafe au lait, so it is good value. But I am usually pleased with any drink I order.\\n\\nBeyond the good coffee, the location is second to none. Right on the lake, the views are great. The huge open deck is dog friendly, and there is no smoking in the covered parts of the patio, so it is easy to enjoy a cup of coffee and get some fresh air. Smokers can sit outside and enjoy their coffee with a great view if they wish in the uncovered areas, so there is something for everyone. \\n\\nThey also have live music of Fridays and Saturdays, which is nice. \\n\\nInsider tip: When you go to Mozart's do not even try to park down near the Lake, instead park in the extended parking lot across the street and just walk down the hill, it will save you much frustration."},{"name":"Black Cat Cantina","address":"18901 E Burnside","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Meowza!

I was even more thrilled to discover that the delicious burgers were pretty much indistinguishable as the ones served at the original location, ditto the delectable and huge fries and onion rings (always go for the half & half option).  The burgers are huge yet deliciously flavorful, blood and juices dripping down onto the fries and rings out of the medium rare burger (must be ordered this way).  The fries are more large potato wedges in reality, and are matched in size by the rings coated with a perfectly crisp batter.  Outside of the burgers, I was also pleased with the version of the locally beloved dish of steak tips.   While the presentation fell short of the beautiful display serve ed up across town at the Lazy Dogs Sports bar, they were certainly among the best I have sampled across the metro, wonderfully juicy and flavorful thanks in part to the aggressive marinade.  \\n    While the decor, much like the somerville original is pretty much generic faux Irish pub, the service is the best that can be found at these type of establishments.  The owner has wisely decided to transfer some of the popular and professional veteran staff members from the original to the new location,  as well as spending the majority of his time here personally overseeing things here while it gets off the ground.  So far his hard work and attention have seemingly paid off,  as the grateful residents and workers have steadily filled the place on both middays and evenings on any occasion I have stopped by.

The restaurant is cozy, with seating for about 20 people, and it's open to the kitchen which is noisy but adds to the atmosphere. \\n\\nFood: \\nEverything looked and smelled delicious, I wish I could try it all! \\n- Calamari - breaded & fried, served hot. Crispy and light, with the calamari cooked to perfection! It was not chewy at all - we easily shared a small between 2 people \\n- Butternut squash ravioli in lobster cream sauce - soooo good - the ravioli is hand made, with fresh pasta, and filled with the sweet squash filling. The cream sauce is rich but not overpowering. When I come back, I'm ordering this. \\n- Fruit di mare with Giacomo's sauce - a red cream sauce with lobster base and generous on the garlic - a compilation of flavors that make you want to keep on eating long after you're stuffed. The seafood was also perfectly cooked - no chewy scallops or calamari here! A generous portion of muscles an clams too. \\n\\nService: \\nWaitresses work well to quickly serve everyone to accommodate the large crowd outside. They are friendly but move swiftly so you have to catch them! \\n\\nPrice: \\nentrees: $14-20, very reasonable wines at $4.50/glass. No desserts (that we saw, at least)"},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love the atmosphere; it's a great place to kill some time with a book or meet up with a friend.

If you like chicken parm subs, you pretty much have to love this place. I'm a fan of their salads, and their pasta trades in the usual massive portions for delicacy and quality... but still plenty to eat. \\n\\nAs I mentioned, I'd get any of their subs, and their Amatriciana pasta with linguini will wake you right up. Their pizza, like their bread, is just the perfect mix of crunchy outer crusts and soft (yet flavorful) centers. The cheese is fresh, whatever the type (although the fresh mozzarella is SO good), and the mild sauce lets you enjoy a flavor profile that is mellower than the salt-sugar bombs you get from *insert chain pizza joint name here*. \\n\\nThat might be the ONE issue people have with Alfredo's however. They are going for a classic Italian flavor profile, which means the garlic isn't just smooshed on everything (although you're depriving yourself if you don't try their garlic bread and bruschetta). Some people are going to feel the sauce is on the bland side, but try a few bites to get your palette adjusted and you start to get the fresh plum tomatoes, and the taste of REAL fresh baked goods, and cheese. \\n\\nBy the way, their cannoli, while tiny for their price, are delectable. They clearly whip honey into the ricotta, and instead of a thick oily crust, the shell is fresh and light. If you're a college student looking to get 2 meals from 1 sub... this is not the place for you. I've been in that situation, and other places have a better value per volume.

It comes with cilantro infused sour cream and a tomato/onion vinaigrette-type mixture (like a basic salsa) on a bed of lettuce.\\n\\nThe challenge is that the chicken was a bit on the dry side and not fully marinated in my opinion. That made bites not as flavorful as they could have been. Now the cilantro infused sour cream and the tomato/onion/lettuce mix help moisten bites and add some mild flavor, but it was clearly apparent the main draw, the chicken, was not. Oh, and while I don't want my quesadilla overpowered with cheese, this one could have used a bit more, especially with the lack of flavor.\\n\\nThe service was very quick - too quick at times. While I appreciated the speediness of being greeted, watered, and order taken, it would have been nice to have a little more time to enjoy the place before running up on me to give me the bill, then stalk me till I paid it.\\n\\nThere's always room for improvement in the food and service industry, even with five star service.

I have tried Theo's on three occasions and all three times was left rather unsatisfied by the level of their service. It is so bad we have internal discussions before we call and remind each-other that the staff is incapable of properly taking an order or even making the most minor of alterations from the menu, such as changing a  sandwich order from a wrap to a sub roll or adding a topping to a pizza. On my most recent order the staff member inquired if there was anything else needed for my order. I twice said that there was nothing else needed.  Theo's hung up the phone without a goodbye and (as this is sadly normal for them) I assumed all was well.  Unfortunately for me they did not bother to communicate with me that they were having difficulty hearing me and at the conclusion of our call they did not call me back to inform me that they had an issue completing my order.

I came here to meet up with some family and it was the perfect restaurant for our meet-up. \\n\\nI did something I normally never do, I did not order any bao for myself. What I did do is I took a bite out of everyone else's bao which is good for my Yelp review because I got to try a significant portion of the menu that way. There wasn't a bao that I tried that I didn't care for- they were all delicious. Even my extremely picky-eater father who doesn't like trying new things (and who got out voted on what restaurant to eat at) had no complaints. I have to say my favorites were the shrimp and avocado bao and the Hogzilla. So flavorful! I was a little disappointed that they didn't have an assortment of asian drinks to try (I was expecting boba teas or something similar) - just sodas and sweet tea. We also ordered the two sweet Bao's to share with the table. The fried bao with caramel sauce, peanuts and ice cream seemed to be more popular with my family than the one with Nutella (even though you can never go wrong with Nutella). They are small enough that you really could eat a dessert bao yourself without feeling guilty about it. If anything is better than sticky buns it's FRIED sticky buns. \\n\\nI know that this place is marked at one dollar sign which could be accurate but it's roughly $3 for one bao. Just to put into perspective how much food you may need to order to feel satisfied, my husband (not a big guy) ordered 3 bao's for himself and finished the dessert bao's that we shared. \\n\\nParking is always going to be tight on this side of town.

While there is a Persian restaurant just 25 minutes from my house down in San Antonio, I will drive the 1 hour and 15 minutes to Alborz any day of the week. \\n\\nReason #1: Price. Alborz is really reasonably priced. A typical dinner here with my wife with dessert and 2 glasses of wine averages about $60 including tip. If you are new to Persian cuisine, and I really encourage you to try it, you can try their new dinner buffet which is $12.99. They have a daily lunch buffet as well, again reasonably priced.\\n\\nReason #2: Quality. Consistency. Each time I have eaten here the food tastes as good as the previous visit. The portions are generous and you will want to leave room for dessert.\\n\\nReason #3: Ambiance (dinner). I know some people may not totally agree on this, but my wife and I both enjoy the warm decor, candlelight and  belly dancing on the weekends. It's cozy and welcoming. \\n\\nReason #4: Service. We have NEVER had a bad server; they're always very attentive and helpful. The manager, Doug, has been here as long as I've been dining here (since 2003 by my recollection) and he is simply outstanding. He'll stop by and ask how everything is, answer any questions and go out of his way to make your dining experience better.\\n\\nReason #5: Healthy cuisine. Yes, Persian cuisine is actually healthy in that less oils are used in food preparation and there's a greater concentration of vegetables. The server will bring to your table Panir Sabzi; Persian Lavash bread served with the Persian version of Feta, Mint, Chives and Cilantro. My absolute favorite dish is the Kashk-O-Bademjan, a puree of baked Eggplant, Onions, Mint, Garlic and Walnuts. Topped with Kashk (whey). It is our favorite! Given enough, I could make a meal of this and the Panir Sabzi!\\n\\nMy typical dinner is usually Panir Sabzi, Kashk-O-Bademjan, Must-O-Khiar, Chelo Kebab-E-Barg and a side of Shirazi Salad. Either Sholeh Zard (Persian Rice Pudding) or my wife's favorite Roulette (Persian cake with whipped cream, Peaches and Pistachio. Very similar to the Puerto Rican \\"Brazo Gitano\\".)\\n\\nThis is the best place in the San Antonio - Austin corridor for Persian, hands down! Worth the drive from anywhere.

It was worth the $20 restaurant week price but I would never pay full price. For the appetizer I got the crab and corn chowder. It was overly seasoned and not very hot. The other people I was with got salads and the greens looked a little wilty. For the main course I got filet with garlic mashed. The steak was okay, but not great. It's wasn't dry aged and was just the standard angus filet you would buy at your local supermarket. They even touted that it was \\"corn fed\\" beef. Almost all commercial beef is corn fed. A grass fed aged steak would have been way better. They also put a big hunk of butter on the steak that makes it overly salty.  I'm fairly certain the mashed potatoes were instant. They were runny and bland. The only desert option was bread pudding with a whiskey sauce. The sauce tasted more like lemon than whiskey and the bread pudding was luke warm. It was as though they couldn't decided whether to serve it hot or cold. The wait staff was AWFUL the main waitress was nice enough but the guys who brought our food constantly gave the wrong thing to each person. They also had a look on their face that they had somewhere way more important to be. The bottom line is that if I was eating at a high end chain I woudn't go back to Ruth Chris.

But then I made the mistake of trying to have a cake delivered for my friend's birthday.  I chose Flour because I knew firsthand that the baked goods were good, but mostly because the bakery is right around the corner from the birthday boy's office.  I was willing to plunk down the $40 for a cake, which to me is an awful lot of money for a cake to feed 6, and hoped they would work with me on the delivery fee since the cake's destination was so close by.  Wrong, wrong, wrong!  When I asked what the delivery fee would be for someone to walk the cake 30 feet down the sidewalk and up the elevator, the guy taking my order very reluctantly went to ask the manager, who was otherwise engaged.  He came back and informed me that it would be the full fee - yes, the full delivery fee of $30 - in order to have the cake delivered to the next building over.  When I pointed out that it was literally next door and would take less than 5 minutes, he feebly protested, \\"Yeah, but someone would still have to leave and so it's the full delivery fee.\\"  \\n\\nThis disgusted me on multiple levels;  first, why does it cost the as much to have someone drive a cake across town as it does to walk it next door?  Second, I always thought that the greatest thing about independent business is that they're run by real people rather than slaves to corporate policy.  They can be flexible.  The small businesses I have worked for have always been accommodating to customers.  But Flour?  They couldn't have cared less whether or not I ordered one of their cakes.  Soooo I didn't, and I won't.  \\n\\nFYI, KickAss Cupcakes, yelp what you will about them, drove a dozen cupcakes from Somerville to South Boston for a mere $15."},{"name":"Forage","address":"5 Craigie Cir","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Cozy basement restaurant on a quiet street in Cambridge.

We had put in a reservation about a month ahead with no issue.  When we arrived the hostess told us it would be couple minutes so we went to the bar to grab a drink.  While the bar area can get a little crowded and is a bit hard to navigate, the entire staff does an excellent job to make sure that you are being served no matter where you are standing.  We put in an order for a Sazerac and a Hendricks Gin Gimlet.  Within a minute of ordering drinks a hostess came and told us that there was opening at the Chef's table, which we jumped all over.\\n\\nWe were promptly sat at the Chef's table, a granite four-top that is literally next to the kitchen.  Nothing separates you from the kitchen staff, no glass window or anything, and it's amazing.  It's like dinner and a movie, but better, and yummier.  Our waiter asked if we wanted anything to drink and I just mentioned that we had put in an order for a couple drinks over at the bar.  Within minutes, a hostess came by with the drinks and comped both of them because of the wait.  It really wasn't too long at all, but we were thrilled with their attention to detail.\\n\\nWe ordered the 6 course tasting menu and told the waiter that we ate everything, no dietary restrictions.  Awesome, we are in for a ride.  We started off with a amuse bouche of three types of seafood.  Squid noodles, smoked halibut, and a crispy potato and cod fritter.  Each one supposedly got more intense, but I honestly fell in love with the squid noodles, best taste so far.  First course comes out, Halibut ceviche with lemon oil and dehydrated corn powder.  Best dish so far.  Second course, crispy frogs legs with chorizo, best dish so far.  Rabbit and chile stuffed pasta, best dish so far.  Tony Maws and his staff outdid themselves dish after dish.  Veal sweetbread, duck, sheepsmilk cheesecake, anise ice cream.  God, I don't even know.  We ordered another round of drinks off their cocktail menu, and they came promptly and were amazing.  Extremely creative, well balanced, and using house-made ingredients.\\n\\nThe meal was fantastic, there is no doubt about it, there wasn't a single under or overcooked item, all the tastes, flavors, colors, they all popped individually together.  It was a goddamn symphony in my mouth.\\n\\nThe kitchen was amazing.  Getting to see how they worked together, how they encouraged, chided, and worked so efficiently was amazing.  plating was amazing, Tony manages his staff extremely well, they are a well-oiled machine.  He even served us one of the dishes and checked in from time to time.\\n\\nCraigie is amazing, it's not a meal, it's an experience, the best one you can have. Beyond the food and drink, the service is impeccable.  Everyone on the floor shares an equal responsibility to the patrons outside of their own specific job.  All the waiters wait on everyone, the hostesses wait and serve drinks, the managers do too.  Attention to detail and perfection are standard for them.  There is no above and beyond for them, if they can do anything better, they do it because it should be standard.\\n\\nCraigie has ruined my life.

We decided to delay our visit a day & did lunch on Monday and there was no wait at noon with plenty of available seating & parking. Go during the week & definitely not on a holiday. My husband had the Thurman's Choice plate. He said the brisket was very tender and lean. The smoke-ring was very well defined & had good flavor. The pork rib was very tender and meaty. It had a good smoky flavor. There was nothing special to the sausage & he could get it anywhere. I don't eat meat so I had the sides, none of which are traditional. So throw all your preconceived expectations out of the window. Having said that, all sides were scrumptious! The potato salad is basically boiled potatoes with their signature BBQ sauce mixed in (as described by our waiter). It looked like corned beef hash to be quite honest due to the color but I assure you there was no meat in it. The cole slaw is vinegar based and had plenty of moisture. The beans were delicious & I am guessing there has to be a BBQ sauce element to their beans as well as they tasted like ranch style beans. This vegetarian was quite satisfied! Just a tip if ordering sides only, save a little by ordering individual sides of beans, cole slaw, & potato salad. You get larger portions & pay less than ordering the vegetable plate. The loaf bread was reminiscent of hotdog buns & was tasty & great to dip in the sauce. The spicy BBQ sauce was NOT spicy so don't be afraid to give it a try. I like a little spice & this wasn't even close to that.\\n\\nThe only reason for the 4 stars (I would have given 4.5 if able) is because of two things: 1) the iced tea was very weak & tasted like water and 2) we waited about 20 minutes after ordering before our food arrived. The restaurant was not busy at all. BBQ is already prepared & I had read on here that food came out quick after ordering. Maybe everybody was still recovering after last night's Father's Day rush. We won't hold it against them & will definitely be back (on a week day)."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great food, great service!

Since this place had such great reviews and the price seemed right, we figured we'd give it a shot. For people who haven't been, beware that it is a TINY place that does not take reservations and is cash only. We knew this going in so it wasn't too big of a deal.\\n\\nWe arrived and there was a line out the door, which is understandable since the restaurant is so small; we put our party size down and were told that it would be about 20 minutes (obviously about 40, in restaurant time). The wait wasn't too bad though; we were in no rush and more than willing to wait for what was supposed to be a superb meal. However, that was not what we got.\\n\\nSure, the food was good, but 40 minutes standing in the cold good? Nah. The service was also so fast that it was actually a bit sloppy; the waitress was nice, but got impatient when one member of our party took more than a few seconds to order. I understand that they are trying to move people in and out rather fast, but the efficiency which which they took our orders, served, and billed us had the effect of making the meal feel rushed. This would have been fine if the food made up for it, but that sadly was not the case.\\n\\nI ordered the caprese salad for an apetizer and it was fine, but nothing spectacular. The roasted red peppers that came with it were a nice touch, but it seemed to be a little light with the mozzarella; there wasn't enough to go with all the tomatoes/peppers. Not a big deal. The real deal breaker of the meal was our entrees; my pasta came out fast, but literally floating in a pool of grease---- there was more oil on the plate than actual sauce! It tasted good, mainly because of the butternut filling, but I found it inexcusable that they would plate a dish that looked like a grease-soup. My girlfriend's was also similarly greasy, though not as bad (we suspect they cooked ours in the same pan and plated mine second, causing all the grease to pool on mine). Our friend's pumpkin tortellini was not greasy, but rather unremarkable. The sauce was rather bland and the filling just mediocre. \\n\\nIf I could do it again, there's no way I'd wait that long for a meal thats just \\"okay.\\" Thus, 2.5 stars. Decent food, but not worth the wait. If you do go, I would suggest sticking to one of their more basic pasta dishes and sauces; some other people sitting nearby had ordered them and they looked pretty good."},{"name":"MADdogs Gourmet Hot Dogs","address":"1900 NE 162nd Ave, Ste D114","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Wasn't as good as I was hoping.

If you see a line stretched out the door; it has to be good! \\n\\nStand in line, talk with the strangers standing in line with you. People are friendly. Why not make a new friend while standing in line? There's a good chance you'll be sitting next to them again.  It's a small tiny place.\\n\\nYes, try the butternut squash ravioli! Really good! The creamy sauce is a bit on the sweet side, but it compliments it well!\\n\\nThe fried calamari....crunchy goodness! Tender....not chewy!\\n\\nThe wait staff was a bit pushy, as in asking if we would like to order the minute we sat down.  I can forgive them because I understand that have to turn tables fast with a line down the block.\\n\\nPrices won't break the bank!!! Great Italian food!

Unfortunately this year 4/5 times that I've tried to have dinner at Deadalus' rooftop the hostess has given some excuse about the roofs unavailability -- the most ridiculous being that it will probably (30% chance) rain in 45 minutes therefore they don't serve food?!?
