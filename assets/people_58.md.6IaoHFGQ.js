My first issue is that there was no drink bar at the event, we had expressed that we wanted a drink bar in addition to guests being asked for their drink order upon being seated. Guests were not asked for their drinks until my husband and I, along with our guests, expressed that it the orders were not being taken. Not including the drink bar in addition to the service for the drinks reveals your poor service and is an embarrassment to the hosts of the party.  The coffee served to all the guests was both cold and tasted old. The second issue is the appetizers. The first is that it being served at the same time as the buffet, which we did request, meant that a majority of the guests made their way to the buffet, and yet the appetizers ran out within minutes. When a dish from the appetizers ran out it took minutes at a time to be replaced. The their issue is that there was not and I do not believe all the appetizers for 110 people was intact served. When Natalie expressed that it was, I told her to get appetizers from the kitchen, anything, and that we would pay for it. Because an expectation that we made clear to Natalie multiple times prior to the event, is that we don't want anything running out and that we would pay for overages, and yet Natalie chose to do as she wished and brought out the desserts during dinner. There was no bread and butter served.\\nMoving on to dinner, there were several problems that reflected badly on the hosts and the restaurant. For one, the food took minutes at a time to be replenished. I witnessed multiple times guests having no options to chose from. I appreciate the effort to make the aesthetic appealing, thus decreasing the food per tray, but there should have been servers keeping an eye and replenishing constantly and consistently. Guests walking through the line and not having food to put in their plates is problematic. The second issue is running out of plates twice and having the guests waiting until I had notified the servers, they were neither attentive to the food nor the plates. The third issue is that the pasta primavera did not have the sauce, the pasta was served bare. I know this was a mistake as I had a tasting that included the primavera and had requested \\"that the sauce have more flavor and be spicier.\\"  Having a pasta without sauce for guests to eat from is troublesome. \\nI understand the the dessert was a buffet, but with every cake cutting I have ever experienced the cake would be served directly to the guests table. The second issue is that the cake slices were embarrassingly small, especially with a cake meant to feed 120 people. \\nIn addition, the bride had requested fruit and was told my a server that we had run out of what we had ordered. I am fuming because I have never seen such inconsideration to a bride and because I hope it was not said to any of the guests. I had made it explicitly clear that nothing was to run out, you would think I had the party in a venue in which the caterers had limited quantities, but being a restaurant this reflected badly on Ray's to everyone at the event. I do not accept that this happened, this is an embarrassment to the hosts that made it very clear that this was not to happen.\\nI do hope this is not something every couple who choses to host their special day at Ray's experiences."},{"name":"Crush","address":"1400 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We came to Crush for the first time tonight and really loved the food and service.

In the course of 4 years, took friends and visitors often, as I really wanted this business to do well. But they had to make the Best Restaurants 2012 list.  The last two times I went, you could just tell that they had stopped trying, and the hipsters are gobbling it all up anyway. \\nThe \\"best chicken in town\\" is now roasted, put away in an oven tray to keep warm,and therefore charred, dry and pitiful looking. Also, the Japanese-influenced china now used allows for minimal quantities of sides provided. They are using that annoying \\"artful plattering\\" technique to justify one slice of potato ore a slice of corn as a side...\\nMy very last time there, I ordered a fish ceviche as an appetizer and cubes of raw tilapia were brought in a bowl, with slivered red onion and just squeezed lime juice not even permeating it. (Ceviche has to be marinated at least one hour in the lime juice, it is not sashimi). We had to have our drinks... entrees... dessert... and coffee... before we could see that the ceviche was acceptably \\"lime-cooked\\"... \\nWon't be going back.

Upstairs and downstairs both hold beautiful, well-stocked bars and there were a number of tables on both levels  with seating along a long booth flanked tables. A large outdoor patio looked welcoming and I would have preferred to have been offered the option to sit there, but the open kitchen was fun to watch from the bottom level. Now on to the good part...\\n\\nOur first appetizer consisted of broiled oysters with lump crab and spiced bread crumbs, which were deliciously buttery and slightly spicy. They were a bit small, but I have no complaints because 1. We're at a BBQ place and 2. They were tasty! The other appetizer was the green chili queso. Nothing special here (again, no complaining) except the house fried chips were perfect: not overly greasy and mighty crunchy, but now jagged like some restaurant chips (think Captain Crunch jagged). I prefer the queso and Kerbey Lane (white queso.)\\nBy then we had noticed the dessert special- ginger shortbread crusted blueberry white chocolate cheese cake. I knew I couldn't pass this up and was looking forward to it at the end. \\nThe epic part of the meal came in store of the house rubbed brisket with a side boat of  BAKED Mac and cheese. The brisket was the best I've had in Austin so far (I've yet to go to Franklin). The coffee in the rub came through nicely and the meat was so tender that there was no need for a knife. Simply amazing. By the time the Mac and cheese was getting nibbled on, I knew this meal was coming to a close pre-dessert. It was so heavenly that it seemed like an appropriate finale. I was overwhelmingly surprised to discover this was the best part of our meal. This is coming from a BBQ lover forever. The cheese they use must have been sent down from cows on Mt. Olympus with noodles from beyond perfection and baked in Shangri La.

There was also salsa served with it which was a nice touch to the dish and added some spicy flavors. The fish tacos were delicious! The only negative thing I can say about this meal was that my fish was a little chewy and over cooked. Otherwise, I can't complain about anything.

The shrimp was dipped in a very thick soggy batter, and the shrimp was raw.  I told the server and she had this puzzled look on her face and didn't know what to do. After a few \\"ums\\" and \\"ok\\" (no apology may I add) she took my plate to the kitchen. She later returned and told me they were remaking it. What I can only assume to be the chef came out with the remake order. It was cooked a little more than the first, but still raw. By this point I was fed up and just wanted the check. I didn't bother to tell them it was still raw because if they couldn't make it right the first two times, what difference would a third be? No manager ever came by to apologize or check on us. When we got the bill $11 roll was still on our bill. I understand that sometimes you just screw up, but if the situation is handled correctly, you can still bounce back. Sadly it was not the case.

Okay, easy enough to remove what we didn't want, but then I noticed the beans. The put WHOLE pinto beans on the chips. Just scattered about and covered with very little cheese. Living in different parts of Texas my whole life, I have never seen anyone put whole pinto beans on nachos. In Texas, it's refried beans!! Then I noticed that the beans that came with the fajitas were also whole pinto beans. Again, not what you normally seen as the beans that come with fajitas. I asked our server why they used whole pinto beans. She said that this is a different kind of restaurant. I told her that it's unfortunately they have chosen to make their nachos as if we are in the north east. She then admitted that they don't have any retried beans!!!! What??? You have a lot of tex-mex items on the menu and no refried beans??  Good grief.

At the end of the night it ends up costing more than AYCE but ALL your dishes are high-end meats, shrimp balls, tofus and veggies. The meat slices here are better than any other hot pot place because they are charging you for it. But seriously the plate is gigantic. I was so full. A+ for the AAA beef slices and succulent lamb.\\n\\nTheir special spicy soup was delicious. Very different from other hot pot places. A Mongolian style hot pot filled with a lot of different spices it was fragrant and mouth-watering.\\n\\nMy only complaint would be their sauce counter is bare. The green onions were all gone, they didn't refill it. Then there's only soy sauce, chili oil and cilantro. I like to have a lot more in my sauce, thumbs down for that. The sauce is the most integral part of my hot pot meal!\\n\\nPRICE: On the higher end for a hot pot dinner. But worth it.\\n\\nSERVICE: Hmm, slow.

Collins ratings), but it's just not to be.  I've tried three locations, and they're all the same.  And it's one thing that the folks at Burritophile.com are right-on about: ho-hum burritos that you're expected to jazz up with a ridiculous assortment of bottled hot sauces.  That's not the key to a good burrito, folks.  But I digress.\\n\\nThere are some very good aspects of this place that save them from one-star banishment.  A choice of not only tortilla types (such as whole wheat or spinach), but sizes as well.  We all know most Cali-style burrito joints serve up huge bricks that weigh your belly down like a...huge...brick.  Big City gives you not only the usual 12\\" shells but 10\\" as well.  Two inches doesn't sound like that much on paper, but they hold just enough less filling inside to make them just about perfect for anyone but a football player.\\n\\nAnd they melt your choice of cheese on the shell *before* putting the ingredients on.  I virtually never get cheese in mine, but if I did, that would be a big bonus...melted cheese just adds a little more \\"scrumptiousness\\" to a burrito.\\n\\nThey're mostly known for their potato burrito, which I haven't had, but some swear by it.  Maybe I'm missing the one reason they're rated so highly, but I try to look at the big picture when rating a restaurant, and frankly...I just don't want a *potato* burrito when my burrito-craving kicks in.\\n\\nSo, let's see...do they offer grilled chicken?  Nope.  How about fajita vegetables?  Nope.  They have a weird vegetable concoction consisting of zucchini, cabbage, and carrots. Um, okay...no thank you.  Unusual seems to be the thing here...they have a \\"chicken bay leaf\\" steam tray that they advertise as being like chicken soup.  A chicken soup-flavored burrito.  Mmmm...no.  Or the chicken mole, which bears no resemblance to any mole sauce I've ever had...it's hardly flavored at all, much less sporting a rich, thick, chocolate-infused burst.\\n\\nI just never come away from Big City with what I really want.  The fixings (e.g., pico de gallo) aren't especially fresh looking or tasting, and that's a big problem.  Mmmm, guac out of a caulking gun, my favorite.  Sure, go nuts with the bottled hot sauces to repair the burritos, but what's the point in that?  Burning your tongue to escape the blandness?  I can get a better base burrito elsewhere that doesn't need doctoring.\\n\\nBut like I said, there are some good ideas here, and they have carved a potato niche apparently, but they really need to punch things up a bit to get my business.

I'm hoping it will improve as the place gets settled as it just opened a couple weeks ago. \\n\\nTo start we ordered the \\"deli\\" board as they called it. It was just plain weird- as if there was some supermarket challenge to assemble a cheese board with 5$ in 5 min at a market basket.

Then there were three cheeses, which the waiter described as \\"goat cheese, Brie, and another cheese\\" and some sliced meats. All were good, but nothing adventurous about it. And then, as all good cheese boards have, something sweet- I think it was supposed to be a compote but it appeared to be chopped honeydew melon??

It certainly saved me from the otherwise stressful trips to Chinatown. Competition is also a beautiful thing. Ming's is one of the more recent additions in Malden with their opening in March 2016 so it's been just over a year. I dined in for dinner twice in the latter months with the most recent being on Mother's Day.\\n\\nThis review is for dinner only.\\n\\nMing's by far is the most gorgeous Chinese restaurant that I have ever been to, interior design wise. Not a hard category to beat considering 10/10 Chinese restaurants have pretty shitty interiors. The \\"WOW\\" factor / interior at Ming's is simply jaw-droppingly beautiful with the sparkly chandeliers, attractive furniture (even the high chairs for kids are upscale), tasteful curtains on the side, etc. There are simply no Chinese restaurants that can even come close to this level of upscale appearance, I think it will stay this way for a while. One note though, the bathroom still doesn't feel upscale/clean to match the rest of the restaurant; the cheap hand soap + container, manual paper towel dispenser, and wet floors are a bit off-putting for a nice restaurant. It's also odd the bathroom doors have sections of see-through glass; it screams of sexual harassment lawsuit.\\n\\nWith that out of the way, I will say the Mother's Day dinner was quite easily one of the worst dining experiences at a Chinese restaurant I have experienced. We reserved a table for Mother's Day and was prompted seated, but that was the only thing that went smoothly, albeit we got a table right behind reception. \\n\\nThe biggest frustration with this dinner was the delay between the arrival of each dish for about 1 hours and 30 minutes. Each time food was brought to the table, it was devoured within mere minutes because there would be nothing else to munch on. I observed the kitchen doors and at some points during the night, there would be only 3 dishes being served within a 15 minute time span - the restaurant was completely filled, which meant everybody was waiting for their food. When was the last time you've had Chinese food so severely delayed? \\"Never\\" was my answer. The quality and taste of the food was also a huge letdown:\\n\\nEgg white dried scallop fried rice: virtually tasteless. The scarce dried scallops and missing scallion did not do this dish any favors by taking away the fragrant smell and taste. The portions are also relatively small.\\n\\nSteak with Chinese broccoli: steak was very tendon-y and rare. And I mean rare, like dark red center rare. The presentation was very sloppy with the broccoli not perfectly aligned and steak slices in awkward positions.\\n\\nMei cai duck tongue: all you can taste is the salty soy sauce. The aromatic mei cai sauce is supposed to shine through, but did not.\\n\\nSteamed oysters: barely enough black bean and soy sauce to give it the boosted taste and smooth texture.\\n\\nDeep fried salted egg yolk silver fish: highly skimped on the salted egg yolk that one can barely taste it.\\n\\nCrispy fried chicken: it tasted fine, but not spectacular. The chicken wasn't plated very neatly, it was chopped in a hurry and thrown on the plate. The uneven cuts also displayed novice cutting skills by the chef. And the dish came about 1 hours and 30 minutes into dinner.\\n\\nFish maw & shredded duck soup: forgetful, fish maw was not soft and soup itself was not tasty.\\n\\nSizzling frog cooked in garlic: not bad, but not as fragrant as it should be.\\n\\nThe servers are friendly and attentive, but disorganized. They tried to give us food that had already been served to us.\\n\\nIn summary, I don't like to give low ratings, but sadly, two-stars is already quite generous for the experience; \\"Eek, methinks not\\" is a more fitting description. The extra star is for the beautiful interior and the sympathetic servers who constantly apologized because they knew the kitchen did not have their shit together. It's a very unfortunate loss of opportunity for both parties. I for one, was already contemplating on planning large events here due to it's upscale interior, but after this experience, I am having major second thoughts.

Me and my four-legged friend Louie trotted down the lane, smelling the roses and marking our territory, off to get some sushi rolls. \\n\\nJust over $20 for 4 rolls ain't a bad thing y'all.

I don't think I'll have it again. \\n\\nBut the winner was Swamp Roll! Tabasco crawfish and pickled okra? Yes please! There wasn't much Tabasco, but there sure was a lot of flavor!\\n\\nThe only things that I'd say could use improvement? For some reason the rice wasn't up to par yesterday. I can't really describe it, but it wasn't quite right. Also, they give you one soy sauce, wasabi and ginger packet for each roll. Not bad, but they don't give you anything to put that in. So you have to either creatively pour it over your sushi or find a corner of your sushi box and smash your roll pieces in there to get the juice.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd be back.

I mentioned it to a gentleman inside (not sure what he did... French accent and nice shirt but seemed to not do much).  He said he would deal with it.  Gee - my parents got to walk through it a second time! \\n- 1 Star - Server's knowledge.  I would expect that a server would know from where the more exotic cuts of meat are sourced.  Venison, duck, buffalo - where are they from, whether they are fresh or frozen - this is not complex knowledge.

We paid partially with a restaurant.com voucher.  On the voucher it says that a 18% gratuity will be automatically added (ok, sure).  I got the bill and a 20% gratuity was added.  Greedy, imo.\\n+ 1 Star - Decor.  Thoughtful and attractive.  The ceiling was especially lovely with ceiling fans interspersed and one large chandelier in the back corner.

And why would you serve it on a store-bought bun (slightly smashed on top, as though something had been stored on top of it on the shelf).  And the side of cut potatoes, what the heck was up with the excessive seasoning on those?  They were cooked to delightful perfection, crusty on the outside and flakey hot on the inside, but the seasoning was again uncontrolled and overwhelming.  By the bye - when I was given ketchup on the side, I was dismayed that it was in a mini-Heinz bottle.  Did no one else notice the cloth napkins, the tablecloths, the price-tags here?\\n- 1 Star - Apple tartin.  The dough was totally overworked and chewy.  Which was too bad as the apple mixture was perfect.  Oh, and store bought ice cream is poor enough, but to admit to it being Breyers was just cheap.\\n\\nMy parents are older and enjoyed their experience, as they should, since I paid (thank heavens I had a restaurant.com certificate for $50 because the meal, with 1 wine, 1 beer and 2 matinis came out to $170 with the 20% gratuity that Hannibals added) and they got to sing along (quietly) to the oldies.  My mom liked the decor and said she would come back for a drink at the bar.  I would not return as the food was just not that great for a price that was far too high.

But the stark difference between the two cannoli vendors is the cannoli shell. Mike's makes their cannolis in advance and keeps them in chilled display counters, and pre-made cannoli shells, which have been softened by cream and firmed by cold, lose some of that delectable crunch belonging to deep-fried pastry dough.\\n\\nAs Jack R. put it, Modern Pastry wins for the quality of their cannoli.

I ordered an Omelette which comes with potatoes, toast and fruit.  The waitress says because I couldn't have the home fries/potatoes or toast, I could have either gluten free bread or a gluten free bagel.  I opted for the bagel.  My food arrived, carried by another waitress who noticed there were home fries on the plate.  She asked \\"can you have the home fries if you're gluten free? do you have celiacs?\\" I told her yes and she told me they had goofed and needed to remake the entire plate.\\nNot a huge deal but we were on a time limit for our meal and now my dining partner is either going to have to eat without me, then watch me eat, or eat his meal when mine comes back.  So we waited and waited.

I came on a saturday, shortly after it opened, and there was already a line. As I was in line, there was someone explaining the menu and details on how the chicken is cooked. All good signs of a place with good food and good customer service. We ordered a Hot whole chicken with a side of coleslaw split between 2 people. It's ALOT of chicken but I was indecisive on which piece of meat to get and it wasn't much more than ordering 2 separate individual order - so I highly recommend getting the whole chicken and having some delicious leftovers for later. \\n\\nThe chicken: I was expecting maybe a little less sauce on the chicken than what I saw, mainly because i really like the skin to be very crispy. Though, you can definitely taste the cajun flavors and it went really well with the coleslaw. I just felt like i needed a biscuit or something to absorb all of that seasoning/spiciness.

The minute you walk in you are instantly greeted by the aromatic smell of fresh baked pastries and a display that heightens your temptation to indulge.\\n\\nEvery single item you see in front of you is so perfectly constructed and decorated that it almost looks plastic! Their plain, butter croissant is utter flaky perfection with a buttery taste that is just right and satisfies both your taste buds and your stomach. It's even better when paired with a fruit jam such as raspberry or strawberry (the wonderful cashier gave me this tip). The filled croissants come in a variety of flavors and are just as delicious. Among the other items to choose from are fruit filled danishes, tarts and pastries, napoleons, bear claws and so much more. If you are more in the mood for lunch or something that's more on the salty side, don't fret because Croissant Gourmet also serves an array of sandwiches and salads.  In addition, like many bakeries, they have a variety of coffee, espresso drinks and teas to enjoy with your meal.\\n\\nAll of their menu items are made and baked on site, which is why it always smells so delectable inside and out. The bakery is not very large in size, but it clearly appears to be designed in way that allows them to make the most of their space. My favorite part about the bakery's seating arrangements is the cute wooden tables that are placed right in front of the big glass window so you can look out and people watch or simply admire the surroundings. It reminds me of being in England, sitting in a local cafe sipping tea and eating a croissant.

Super fresh with a really nice proportion of fish to other mixed ingredients. I also really enjoy the potato latkes here which are offered with applesauce or sour cream & smoked salmon. I love their latkes for their perfect level of crispiness balanced with light flaky texture on the inside. Other highlights from my experiences are: blintzes, noodle kugel, challah french toast and of course the chopped liver!\\n\\nIt is a pretty decent wait on busier days of the week as I'm sure you've gathered from other reviews.

My dad's side of the family is Cajun, so we know what \\"real\\" Cajun food should taste like. We also know imitation Cajun (*cough, hack, Pappadeaux!*), and based on the sheer number of roues I have taste-tested over the years, I can pick out a worthy gumbo from a lineup, yessiree. This is still the only restaurant in which I have ever seen my dad call over our waiter to send his compliments to the chef after throwing down a miraculous shrimp toupher accompanied by a perfectly seasoned crawfish etouffee and dirty rice. \\n\\nMy own dinner, which started out with a novel Cajun Caprese Salade that included a spicy yet sweet olive oil and ended with rainbow trout stuffed with shrimp, crawfish and scallops, left me fully sated and needing a nap. Or, making me want to try some absinthe. Sadly, that wasn't on the dessert menu.\\n\\nThe wine selection is fairly extensive and compliments the lovely seafood dishes quite well.

So far so good.  Our waiter came by to greet us and handed over the wine list. We pick our bottle of wine and we handed off the menus. After deciding our selection for dinner the waiter stepped back over to the table and asked, \\"What can you afford\\"? I was in a bit of shock that this was the way that we were addressed but even with being shocked, I moved on to inform the waiter on our choices. We went with the four-course meal and made our selections. While we drank our wine we looked around the room. My close friend informed me to slowly look over my shoulder. I turned slowly and saw some candelabras with...fake ivy. On this fake ivy seemed to be an inch of dust. Again, I was flabbergasted to see this in such a fancy restaurant when they can clearly afford fresh flowers. We shrugged it off and moved forward. I kept seeing the food coming out being presented under a silver Hershey kiss shape formation. The waiters would simultaneously \\"with a bang sound\\" remove the covers and present the dish.  I thought to myself, with such a presentation the food must be outstanding. We had our first two appetizers come out without the \\"kiss\\". They were average and nothing to write home to mom about. Side note: I did order the borscht soup, which I was very excited about because I have been to Moscow and it was one of the most memorable parts of the trip. This was nothing close to what I remembered. It brought back one memory. I think me and my friend simultaneously looked at each other and whispered two words...Chef Boyardee. We sat with our empty plates in front of us for just a bit of time. I looked up to see our waiter giving a snarling glace at another waiter to remove our plates and refill our wine. I didn't expect much less from a man that formulated a question of \\"what can you afford\\" and I tried to not let him continue ruining my dinner experience.  Our \\"kisses\\" came out and we got the same presentation as the rest, but when we took a bite from our main meal we were not completely impressed. I thought...it would have been better without the big hype before the release. If you are going to put that much into something I would say that whatever is under that huge silver kiss better be something that would knock me on the floor. We finished and moved on to the last but most disastrous course of the evening. The one that we were hoping would save it all...the desert. Once laid on our table we thought, how beautiful. I had the chocolate mousse  and my friend, the chocolate cake with salted caramel. Oh, side note: The waiter placed the wrong orders in front of us...every time. Moving on, I enjoyed my mousse but there was a small shriek that came from my friend after placing a raspberry in his mouth. It was rotten. We tried to explain this rotten raspberry to our waiter and the manager but the entire rebuttal was that the raspberries were soaked in balsamic vinegar. I was like you served balsamic vinegar raspberries with a chocolate caramel desert? Any even if they did, we found the worst raspberry in the case. The manager didn't seem to care and neither did the waiter. The waiter put down our bill and we said thank you to only get him to snub us with a turn of his back.

Instead, we went over to the 29th street mall the rest of our stay and bought great coffee at Peets and wonderful food and salads at Mod Market. \\n\\nDon't waste your time or money on food or coffee at the Millenium Harvest, it's horrid. \\n\\nWhen we needed to use the emergency phone in the fitness center, it didn't work. The phone by the indoor pool also does not work, so we had to track back and forth to the room to communicate. We could have gone to the front desk, but they always seem understaffed with people waiting to be served, so it made more sense just to walk back to the room. \\n\\nI won't be staying here again."},{"name":"Ming's Seafood Restaurant","address":"19 Pleasant St","city":"Malden","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here for dim sum on Saturday and was surprised that the wait was pretty short (about ten minutes).

So the long and short of this is that the food is quite alright, nothing great. I've had the sushi, tempura, agedashi tofu, the ohitashi and been only disappointed with the ohitashi. The spinach wasn't delicately boiled, it was stringy with no flavor at all. The sesame sauce was ok but didn't do anything for the lackluster spinach. I went there craving for it, so I was very disappointed.\\n\\nBut that isn't the primary reason for a 2.5 star rating, it is because the particular waiter assisting us didn't warn  us about the portion size and incidentally we ended up having too much food. Traditional japanese appetizers have small portions so that you order a variety and pick off them (at least thats how I've eaten japanese food all along) Though, good sized portions are welcome, what wasn't funny was the waiter constantly asking us why we couldn't finish the food. We ended up leaving behind more than half the portion of tempura. They also messed up our sushi order, giving us a repeat of the same instead of two different varieties. I did not specify that I wanted an inside out roll, but they gave us that and charged us extra for it. Too many small things that took away from the food. And the prices aren't exactly cheap. I'll be staying away from Ginza."},{"name":"The Fish & Chip Shop","address":"1218 N Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"After seeing good reviews about this place, I was pretty disappointed.

It is a single stall (M or W) and I chose to hold it rather than go in this bathroom.  The toilet was filthier than a roadside gas station - stuff splattered everywhere.  I was appalled.

I had to walk up to them and tell them I was ready. I looked around and it was me and maybe 3 other tables. Not just at all. The food was pretty good but the drink had way too much sour mix in it(Long Island) and then there was a bigger group that showed up and I was completely forgotten. If I wasn't an honest person I could of gotten up and left and I don't think anyone would of realized it. This place had horrible service and the staff clearly doesn't care if they make a tip or not.

It was markedly different than when I had breakfast there yesterday. I spent some time in the lounge doing work after breakfast and overheard several interactions he had with other customers. He treated each one respectfully and was equally courteous to all. At one point someone had a caller on their cellphone on speaker and I made a face. He saw me and came over to make sure I was ok! I also overheard [Damon]  tell a parent to watch their child as the plate he was about to place on their table was hot (who thinks of these things anymore?!) He spoke to a woman nearby about music in Austin (great city guide) and kept the same demeanor toward all.

We arrived on time and were put in the bar as our table was not ready. We were given a tacky pager/beeper similar to those found in a much lower end restaurant. After 40 minutes in the bar, the pager beeped. When we went to the hostess she told us, \\"No, your table is still not ready and the pager has to beep, flash,AND a voice will tell you to come to the hostess stand!\\" Meanwhile, we gave up our seat in the bar. Then our pager beeped, a voice came on, but oh, no--our table still wasn't ready and the beeper didn't flash--you must have all 3 things occur at the same time--how ridiculous and low rent is that?? The hostess had an attitude, and as we observed, everyone that walked in got a pager. We were not seated until 8:35--nearly 1 HOUR after our reservation. There was no apology for the delay--no drinks on the house.....zip, nothing.\\n\\nWe were seated in a nice area with a view of the river (it was dark by this time, though) but I can say that it is a pretty spot. When our server took drink orders, we were all drinking the house wine so we decided it would be cheaper to order a bottle. Our server returned to tell us that they do not sell house wine by the bottle--we would have to continue ordering by the glass or switch wines....ugh. She had no suggestion of any alternate wine and the overall service was so so at best.\\n\\nThe menu is nice and I will say that my swordfish was delicious. However, it is pricey!! Everything is a la carte and my piece of fish was $30!! I guess I was surprised by the prices because the initial vibe (with the stupid pagers) was that of a less expensive kind of place.\\n\\nIf I am going to a pricey restaurant, I want my reservation honored (or an apology if it isn't), I want the host or hostess to come and find me when my table is ready (no stupid pager), I want a staff that is appreciative of my business (hey, we are in a recession and the tab for the 4 of us was nearly $400--not counting the 2 rounds of drinks in the bar before dinner!)

When the scallops arrived, we had a nervous laugh with my wife. 2 scallops in a little bowl, with a light sauce and exactly twelve corn grains, very good but ridiculously small. When mentioning to the waiter that the quantity was extremely light, he told us that usually people take 2 main course. From a semantic standpoint it's definitely not a main course, if we think about a restaurant as a place where you pay for food with in mind the idea it will calm your hunger, Spoke plays on a dark grey zone. 2 main courses to eat enough would mean $40 (and considered the size of the main course we had, two would not have been enough), which is a price level way over the paper-napkin table-on-the-sidewalk kind of restaurant. \\nSo, an excellent place to go if you have eaten before."},{"name":"Se√±or Frog's","address":"8747 International Drive #103","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Made the mistake of going here before going to Drip last night.

I requested early check in, and my luck would have it, my room was ready even thought it was before 1pm.

The last time I stayed at a hotel light this, the noise level was bad, I could hear everything that was happening everywhere, from the lobby to every hallways... I was a bit worries about it, but I didn't have a choice. This structure design also reminded me of a bit of the movie Matrix... \\n\\nThey have 4 elevators, but they were kind of slow.

In a way, it is good that it is not located in the center of the city. More quiet and peaceful. \\n\\nMost of the staffs were friendly and polite, willing to help with your needs. Some others are more cold, still polite, but not as welcoming. My two nights of stays were comfortable, not complaints. The noise level was not bad, which was surprising with the way this hotel is designed. I slept well on a fluffy bed."},{"name":"Botekim Brazilian Bistro","address":"1410 Terrell Mill Rd SE","city":"Marietta","stars":"4","text":"After all the buzz, my wife and I knew we had to try Botekim, especially since it's so close to our home.  We were NOT disappointed.  From drinks to appetizer to entrees to dessert, it was excellent all around.  We started with the yucca fritters and drinks.  I had a caipirinha (lime) and she had the nights special drink.  I'm not that big a rum fan but mine was awesome and she switched to a caipirinha for our second round.  The fritters were delicious; the malagueta sweet pepper sauce that came with them even more so---sweet and fiery, totally delicious.  Entrees kept up the high standards for the evening.  I had the fish with meuniere sauce (cod that night) and she had the pork loin.  Both plates were beautifully presented and we could have fed three.  The fish was perfectly cooked and her pork loin was expertly cooked, as ordered, and moist and flavorful.  Her sides were awesome, mine was meh (would much rather have had hers on my plate).  Dessert for me was the passion fruit mousse, hers the night's special of ice cream filled puff pastry with home made fudge sauce.  Both were the perfect cappers to our dinner.\\nThe service was impeccable---attentive, warm, without being smothering.  Our server was patient, informative and had a couple of good suggestions that made the meal that much better.  The manager chatted with us twice and made us feel valued and appreciated.\\nWe will heartily recommend Botekim to all of our friends and will definitely be going back to explore more of the menu.  LIttle Brazil in East Cobb?  More than all right by us."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious!

This place is literally down the street from me, and I wouldn't have given it a second glance had I not stumbled upon it here on Yelp. The restaurant is located next to a gas station, practically a hallway between that and another business. Upon first impressions, it's pretty divey. Sad paint with sad, peeling wallpaper border. Ancient plain brown tables akin to what you would find in a sad cafeteria. They have decorated it with their traditional decor however towards the cash register which looked nice. What they are lacking in decoration, they make up for ten fold however in service and enthusiasm. I was greeted by a boisterous gentleman, who instantly made me feel like a regular customer even though it was my first time in. I told him I wanted to place a to-go order, and he ushered me to a table with a menu to wait. I gave him my order and he quickly conveyed it to the cooks without having to write it down (even though it was a pretty good sized order for my husband and I). He brought me a hot cup of tea, (which was rather nice since it was cold and pouring down rain) and a complimentary salad roll with a touch of peanut sauce. Who does that?! It was as if I was spending some time in their personal living room while waiting for my food. Others came in behind me (obvious first timers) and they also seemed surprised to be treated so hospitably while they waited. The food wasn't fast, but within a reasonable amount of time. He apologized for the longer than usual wait, and I told him not a problem at all...with service like that, who minds waiting? \\nWhen we got the food home, it was still hot and delicious. We ordered the yellow curry with chicken, which had all the right flavors and a tiny hint of spice. The carrots and potatoes were neither hard, nor too mushy. The only criticism I would say is that they packaged it in a plastic container (like what you would get at the deli) and it was very precariously sealed and not sturdy. I also do not like when hot foods are packaged in Styrofoam...the plastic flavor sometimes leeches into the flavors when the food is packaged hot. The salad rolls were delicious, and they have a fabulous peanut sauce. The pad thai had come out first while waiting for the rest of our food, so it had gone a little sticky and colder by the time we got home --but the flavor was great.

The baked and deep fried stuff - I can't and won't comment on as I was there for lobster, crab legs, oysters and clams. \\n\\nThe lobsters were small to medium. Walk up and one will be dropped onto your plate. You don't get to choose. The other items, it's self serve. Well, except for the carving station. The oysters were small to medium, not shucked. The seafood salad selection was varied but I only had the octopus salad as the rest didn't look appealing. The crab legs were okay too. \\n\\nStay away from the Sushi. One look was all it took for me to avoid. As for the prime rib, carving station - just time it right. I wasn't there for beef but I will say that when I looked at the offering, it was dry and well done. And I didn't return when other slabs were brought out to compare. After all, i was there for seafood. \\n\\nIt's about $40 a head for adults, $16 for kids.

Parking is across the street in an open lot, along the streets in any available space or in a private lot provided by a valet.\\n\\nWe visited Superica as the beginning of a short crawl that ended at the Dogwood Arts Festival (walking along the Beltline) and ending at Ponce City Market with my friend Arvin R (we eventually picked up Kymber W on the way back). If you haven't been to Krog Street Market yet you really should try it - if for nothing else, the huge beer selection at Hop City - but I digress. On this day we decided to hit Superica for brunch before hitting the Beltline - we had no real plan other than to eat and drink beer, get a little exercise and take in the sights.\\n\\nThe Krog Street Market used to be Tyler Perry's music studio and can be found in Inman Park - it's now a multi-use facility that houses several restaurants and shops and has become an intown destination, with several things to offer including today's visit to Superica. This is my second time at Superica, having visited previously right after they opened and frankly, not having had the best time. Those of you who know me also know that I have one of those cast-iron stomachs that can withstand quite a lot, both is spiciness and in outright obnoxious behaved food - my prior visit to Superica ended with me having a rather painful evening and next day - first time this has happened to me in many years (and that includes a trip to India!). I can only guess that the mojo that I had as Superica was a bit tainted and initially this did not provide further impetus to return. However I finally decided that I should give the restaurant a second try and I'm glad I did.\\n\\nBrunch here was interesting as you can imagine, a South-of-the-Border mix of breakfast food and good Mexican spicy favorites.  We were provided a basket of chips with a few dips which was an awesome way to start things - also on tap my favorite local brew, Creature Comforts Tropicalia. \\n\\nI ordered the  Huevos Rancheros - house tortilla, 2X beans, ranchero sauce, 2 eggs sunny-side up, avcado and bacon. I must say that this is the best version of this classic dish that I've ever had and I've had the dish many, many times in several areas of the US and Mexico.  Everything here worked to build an interesting, textural palate - and it went so well with the tropical citrus in the beer. Simply delicious.\\n\\nArvin ordered the  Chorizo, Potato & Eggs - 2 eggs scrambled with chorizo, potatoes and cheese - really quite a ton of cheese. I tasted these but frankly the didn't compare to mine.\\n\\n We also ordered a side of Hot Cakes - Double Stack with whipped butter and buttermilk syrup as it wouldn't have been a breakfast without pancakes, right?

I overshot the location because it's in a hard to notice corner of a C-shaped strip of tiny storefronts, right at the corner of North Star and W 5th. Having only glanced at the listing, this just isn't what I expected.\\n\\nWalking up, the first thing that struck me was that there was no seating whatsoever. Once inside, this made sense as it was explained that they currently only offer their chili refrigerated or frozen. I was told the ability to serve hot food would have cost them \\"$25,000 in plumbing upgrades\\". We have plenty of commercial grade microwaves at my work, so this didn't really dismay me. \\n\\nWhat did turn my head, however, was the price. A single serving of chili was only $6.50, about on point for most fast meals around the city (but a tad more than you'd pay for a bowl at most restaurants). But if I'm buying it cold and have to heat it anyway, I may as well buy enough for later too, right? Well, I bought a full quart - and that set me back 22 dollars! \\n\\nFrankly, it's crazy. Rather than spend $25k more in start up money so you can serve hot food, you have made the decision to sell cold food that I have to cook. This means your competition is my grocery store. Why on earth should I spend this kind of money on a meal I have to prepare myself when I can buy 8 pounds of chili for that price at the grocery (I'm thinking of Amy's organic chili here, so arguably better quality)? The price break for buying large quantities should be much larger.\\n\\nThe chili itself wasn't bad, but if you've ever been to a chili cook-off, you've had better. I wondered to myself about what has to transpire for someone to think that their chili is good enough to mass produce and sell, and I thought \\"this person must have all kinds of people telling them how good this chili is\\", but I just don't get it. \\n\\nI realize people pour their hearts into starting a small business like this, and I am sympathetic to that. I also hate to come in here with however many hundreds of reviews and 60 yelp fans, laying down the hammer on a new business with just a handful of reviews, but your money is seriously better spent elsewhere. I feel like a host on American Idol or something. JC's just got it wrong. I imagine the idea was serve cold, build a following, make money, then upgrade plumbing and serve hot food.

The meat was cooked well but the sauce was similar to a browned wine gravy. Where's the garlic? Where's the spices? Just felt like they could have done a little more with it. It also came with a grit of some sort which was tastier than I was expecting. Added a nice texture element to the dish which was nice.

We live next to the ocean people - how about fresh seafood?  I have made better shrimp dishes in my own home.  \\n\\nMy dining partner said that her cioppino, which should be an easy dish - almost like a soup with fresh seafood in it - was poorly done and the seafood was over-cooked as well.  \\n\\nAnother writer said this is similar to those seafood restaurants where you ate with your parents.

Y'all! that's cheap! so I run through my item our desert is there then there was a credit for the amount of the desert.

If it is weekend/pay day happy hour, and your table looks like you are out of food and you are still milking your drink and your eyeballs on your precious phone, there are at least 3 groups that are already eying your table and can't wait for you to get up so they can get your table. So just go already, before those stares turn into fire that will burn into your soul.\\n5. Ladies, please do not put your feet up on the chair. It doesn't matter if your nails are painted, have shoes, we don't really wanna see half of your vage while eating sushi- why are you putting your feet up while wearing very short shorts? We don't know if we need to tell you to close it or to put soy sauce on it... If you have a friend that wears this kind, be honest to them.

Sala and Betty is cooking food with immense amounts of love, and you can taste it throughout the entire experience.\\n\\nThis love and attention to detail lives in the fantastic fresh sauces, smoked meats, and comfort touches like fries in the sandwiches. The green beans are seriously the best I have ever had. Breakfast doesn't disappoint, and the service is some of the most personable I have experienced in town.\\n\\nGet to Sala and Betty.

It looks sort of old and rusted from the outside, but surprisingly it's a thriving business that is new, modern and state of the art inside. \\nSome people call me old fashioned, and other say I'm in with the times.... I think, I personally depend upon the situation. Certain things from the past are good to keep, and certain new things are also helpful to have. In this case, the wireless technology is a nice addition and something I think it useful and efficient. The newer furniture, large and open floor plan and huge bathrooms are well thought out, and even the sparkling kitchen looked great. From the counter you are able to see everything that is going on back there, so there is no way for their to be any unwanted sights. Clean and organized is how I'd describe both the kitchen and dining room. \\nDecent menu with lots of options available other than pizza. Sandwiches, burgers, calzones, pastas, salads, soups, wraps, and even a children's menu. Lots of options in every section too. For such a small, local place.... they offer residents and workers a lot of options! \\nPrices are affordable, and other than the lack of sufficient parking, I don't see any issues with this place whatsoever. They also seem to try to keep customers by accepting competitors coupons (the first pizza shop ever, that I've seen to do that...) and offering free Wifi (one in every few). For this area, hours are sufficient, Mon-Sat 11-9, Sun 11-8. \\n4 stars for Pizzadoro's.

My whole family came in from the east coast to celebrate a big birthday. This was supposed to be the birthday dinner and our last night together. They were hesitant to drive all the way out here to eat but I was SO excited about it, I insisted on it. Then after getting here, they told us it would be about an hour and a half but probably sooner because people would start leaving when the sun set. Over 2 hours later we're still standing around waiting, my pregnant sister sitting on the steps tired and uncomfortable, and a staff member on her break tells us the bar is closing. When we told her we were still waiting for our table she calls down to the host stand and sends us down. We're seated as they're cleaning up all the tables around us but still denying that they forgot about us. We ordered guacamole because we were starving and it took probably 20 minutes for the smallest order of guacamole that wouldn't come close to reaching 8 of us. We all sat there silent and uncomfortable and eventually ate some cold food while they turned off all the fans and finished cleaning around us.

Given a very long wait I would probably just give up and eat somewhere else in the building. The food was delicious, pleasing 6 people at the same time is no easy task. The salsas on the table were flavorful and the queso and guacamole were interesting while still feeling familiar. We had an array of entrees from vegetable enchiladas, salads, chicken tacos. I think the sauces in this place are really what makes it shine. They brought out a stick gooey sugary bananas foster type dessert for a birthday treat. Lastly, our waiter was tremendous.

Actually, I'm currently eating at Clover with my mother and my sister. I'm eating a parsnip salad. That's one of the things I love about Clover, they're unique. How many fast food places sell parsnips? This is the first time I've seen parsnip salad on the menu, and that's definitely another thing that keeps me returning: they are always trying new things.\\n\\nIt's about time I give Clover a review, because I buy food from them more often than I buy from any other place that sells food. One day last week I had Clover for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, at 2 different food trucks plus their restaurant location in Cambridge. Their sandwiches are delicious and very reasonably priced, no matter where they are located. \\n\\nI'm a vegetarian so I love the fact that everything on the menu is vegetarian. I've taken meat eating friends here also and they enjoy it as much as I do.\\n\\nThe only thing I'm not fond of here are the sodas, they are too bland for my taste. Although Clover generously offers free tap water with your choice of carbonated, cold, or room temperature, so I can't complain if I don't like the drinks they sell.\\n\\nThe venue itself is also something I enjoy. It's nice and minimalist, and all of the plastic they serve your food in is compostable. My favorite feature is their wall of crayon drawings.

Guys seriously, why?), ordered a few cocktails and a few dishes.  \\n\\nThe service was all about the blonde female bartender, (Emma?). Kick-ass, impeccable service.  The other male bartender that helped us seemed confused as to what he was doing there.\\n\\nThe food & cocktails were \\"hit or miss\\".  The live scallop dish was excellent; the sea urchin didn't taste very fresh; the octopus cooked to perfection, but the potatoes that came with it bland AF; the steak tartare seasoned to death, but not a trace of salt, (wtf guys), with teeny cold, greasy pop-overs that tasted nothing of black pepper as mentioned. The majority of the cocktails were had were suuuuuuper sweet, almost to a point where the balance was completely thrown off.  The signature cocktail in a grapefruit honestly just tasted like a cheap scorpion bowl.  \\n\\nAnd final note, upon leaving the restaurant, there were three employees standing at the host station.  None even bothered to acknowledge our departure.  \\n\\nY'all need to get it together."},{"name":"3 Country Bistro","address":"379 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing!

So if you'd like to stay and enjoy your doughnuts warm (which is the best way to enjoy them), I'd suggest getting there early. By 9:30-10am there is a line out the door. The interior is rustic and comfortable, I really enjoyed it. There's also classic and vintage books for young kids to read with their parents as you partake in the kid-sized doughnuts. \\n\\nThe doughnuts are not large. If you look closely at Pip's offering board they have a \\"life size\\" doughnut posted - they are, at most, as large as the palm of your hand and are definitely \\"kid sized.\\" They have their staple doughnuts that you can always order, a \\"seasonal\\" doughnut, and then a secret menu. (You have to ask for the secret menu list of doughnuts.) And to be totally honest, the only way to eat them is fresh and hot when they give them to you right then and there. I took some home to my boyfriend and within an hour - 1.5hr they weren't nearly as good as the fresh ones I ate there. Also, on your birthday, you get a dozen for free!

For $4-5, you get a huge cannoli. We ordered the following cannoli: pumpkin spice, regular, and pistachio. I got a pistachio cannoli and the crisp, flaky texture of the shell alone won me over.

They will ask you every now and then if you need anything else, but there was no pressure in placing orders.\\n\\nSampled a few of their dishes:\\n\\n1. Scallop Gratin ($7.50) - small pieces of scallop sitting on a bed of mashed potato and bacon bits. This was the smallest dish of them all. Scallops were a bit over-cooked and they could afford to serve more mashed potatoes to compensate for the miniscule scallops.\\n\\n2. Pork Belly Lettuce Wrap ($7.80) - this slices of pork belly with ginger and crunchy noodle to wrap inside lettuce leaves. I like how some of the pork belly were charred to create a crunchy pork fat. Definitely a good dish for repeat order.\\n\\n3. Chan Chan ($10.50) - Salmon and rice served in a stone rice bowl and patiently mixed together by your server when brought to your table. The effect of the hot bowl is for the rice to get toasted similar to the rice at the bottom of a Paella dish. The most decent serving of them all. But then again, its higher priced and really we're talking about an abundance in rice. Still a worthy dish to have by your table.\\n\\n4. Udon Bonara ($8.80) - Looked good on paper, plain and meh when served. Supposed to be their version of \\"Carbonara\\", but all it tasted was plain udon noodles with pepper and cream sauce. Definitely not worth having again.\\n\\n5. Crab Sushi ($9.85) - They should create more maki roll dishes because this one is a winner. Fried rolls wrapped with tasty Dungeness crabs and asparagus. For small portions that they've been providing, this one has a decent size.\\n\\n6. Matcha Brulee ($6.25) - Okay so now back to a tiny portioned ramekin dish. I thought this was tasty. I could appreciate the strength of the matcha and the gritty texture it provided. Still, I don't appreciate restaurants going out of their way to buy tiny ramekin dishes and charge regular dessert prices.\\n\\nDrinks...\\n\\n7. Blue Hapa Tini ($9.00) - Cute and light blue, but really just a boring, tasteless martini drink that had no alcohol taste or strength that I might as well just ordered pineapple juice. Lesson learned in ordering a foo foo drink.\\n\\n8. Sleeman's Pale Ale ($5.75) - Now we're talking.\\n\\nBottomline:\\n\\nThe dishes are not as tasty as other Izakaya restaurants in the Downtown area. The prices are the same, but the ingredients are lacking depth that makes these small dishes small and costly.\\n\\nI was turned off by the auto-gratuity of 18% whether you're one or a group. Really? When there is good service to be had, it will come. Why do we have to take advantage of locals and visitors. Is this the image we want to project during the Olympics? \\"Hey, come on over to Vancouver so we can automatically charge you 18% tip for us!'.\\n\\nI applaud restaurants that maintain their pricing, service and dignity during events like these. I wish I could have said the same of Hapa Izakaya. With that I leave 3 stars.

It holds up well when the pizza has a large number of toppings and the texture is where it needs to be. I thought that the second gluten free crust was better - it was crisper and had a little more char on it. Hopefully this is indicative of the direction they are heading as they dial-in their pizza ovens.\\n\\nMore broadly, I really liked the farm to table approach to their ingredients and the combinations of flavors. That said, I think that their Umami sauce is currently a little sweet and that they need to dial-it back.\\n\\nOutside of pizza, their salad and sandwiches were great. On the second visit I also ordered the Cobb and really enjoyed it. Definitely a meal in and of itself, I didn't need the sandwich I had ordered. That said, the chicken sandwich was out of this world and the best thing I tasted.

She likes hot food and I spent enough time in the state to develop a taste for it.\\n\\nShe ordered the spicy pork with bamboo shoots, but conscious of the two chiles on the sign outside the restaurant, asked for medium.  The pork was juicy and tender, cooked just right, and the bamboo shoots were the best we have eaten.  Her other dish was pork won ton soup.  It was not at all spicy, but the won tons were flavorable and there was not a hint of grease in the excellent broth. \\n\\nThe above dishes were perfect foils for the two I ordered.  Since the helpful waitress didn't even ask how spicy I wanted them, I knew it was buyer - or diner -  beware.  I always try new things when visiting Richmond, so ordered two dishes containing animal parts I had never eaten - beef trachea and pig's ears.  \\n\\nThe first was billed as cow's throat in chile, and that pretty much described it.  A mound of trachea, very thinly sliced crosswise so that it looked like a plate of tiny eels with a sauce that appeared to be mostly chile oil.  It started out very hot and stayed that way, but the heat was manageable when eaten with rice  I liked it and will order it again after I have tried some of the other unusual - to me - animal parts on the menu.\\n\\nThe spicy pig's ears were nothing like I expected.  They were white, cut into bite-sized pieces, and 2-5 millimeters thick.  Must have come from small pigs.  The rest of the dish consisted of onions, green peppers and two kinds of chiles, a red one and a pale green one that we thought was pickled.  The pig's ears were close to neutral in flavor; the dish started out spicy and the heat built with each mouthful, but through it all we could taste the new flavor of the pale green chile.\\n\\nThe next day we met a woman who was born in Chengdu.  She was very familiar with both the trachea and pig's ears dishes as we described them, even using the term \\"trachea\\" instead of \\"throat\\".  However, she told us that the pale-green chiles, very well-known to her, were not pickled.

It's Disney.\\n\\nThis is honestly one of the best places to go for free. I've been going here since it was still \\"Downtown Disney\\", before all of the huge renovations and the parking garages. When STK was a small side bar and little stage where Drey-C and Nicholas Marks played for a super small crowd, when it was just West Side, Pleasure Island, and the Marketplace. To be honest, I do miss it when it was a simple place, but regardless, what it has turned into is still very impressive.\\n\\nThe recently added Town Center side is beautiful. They've added tons of different shops and restaurants to go to, including the new Planet Hollywood, Paddlefish, Blaze Pizza, and Morimoto Asia. There are TONS of unique shops worth visiting around Disney Springs such as the Candy Cauldron, the HUGE World of Disney store, The Soccer shop, Uniqlo, the Super Hero store, Star Wars store, the Lego store, Mickey's Pantry, Harley Davidson gear, and the Coca Cola store. There truly is something for everybody to get excited about. One of my favorite stores is Basin, where you can wash your hands with a scrub and feel your skin at the softest it's ever felt, or get a treat at Ghiradelli. \\n\\nIf you like fun entertainment and don't mind big crowds, go on a Friday night, where you'll see tons of different live shows like Drey-C, basically a cover band, Nicholas Marks (who is the most impressive and talented guitarist I've ever seen), two freestyle rappers, a 3 hour dance party by the stage where the Lego shop is, and many different performers around restaurants. \\n\\nFood here is crazy expensive, so unless you really do feel like spending, go somewhere else. One of the best places to go for great food without the expensive prices is Cookes of Dublin or Blaze Pizza. \\n\\nDisney Springs is also home to unique places such as Cirque du Soleil, the House of Blues where concerts are held, Disney Quest, Splitsville, and the Dine in Theater. Take a ride in the hot air balloon or take the ferry for fun from one side of Disney Springs to another. \\n\\nThis truly is one of my favorite places in Orlando.

Since then, they have found new ways to improve - expanding the menu, adding more comfortable seating, etc. It is different in the sense that it's like a coffeeshop-bar, because of the alcohol they serve alongside cream or caffeine, and also in the entertainment aspect. However, if coffeeshop-bar IS what they are going for, the ambience can be improved upon and the motif will maybe need to \\"grow up\\" a bit more.

Admittedly, for most budgets, the best experience one can have is tolerable, but eating at the world's busiest airport doesn't have to be so bad.

Their coffee menu is extensive and pretty silly in the world of Starbucks and other choices, but interesting none the less. Their cafe salads, pastas, sandwiches, and entree dishes are all very solid. Good variety, good portions, acceptable price.\\n\\nTheir desserts are also very good although very rich. Good prices and a full bar.\\n\\nThe service definitely leaves something to be desired, but isn't too different than expected in an airport. Sometimes you wait for a long time to order and then your food comes out right away. Sometimes you can order right away but then wait for food. \\n\\nThe Cafe is owned by a group who has other restaurants in the Atlanta area - I haven't been to any of those but I think the experience in running non-airport venues pays off in differentiating the Cafe from the rest of available ATL fare.\\n\\nPros: Calm seating with good people watching. A variety of dishes at a reasonable cost.\\n\\nCons: Inconsistent service. As referred to at the start of my review, the Cafe isn't the best food in the airport. That honor goes to One Flew South.

Next came our pizza. While you can build your own from a dreamy list of goodies, we wanted to experience the owner's idea of flavor combining, so we went with the Ninety-Two, topped with red onion, olives, peppers, Italian sausage, Pecorino cheese and (normally) mushrooms. Our server had no problem with our request for fresh basil in place of fungi, and even scrutinized the pie in the dim light upon serving, just to make sure the substitution had been correctly made. In Orlando, I'm so used to indifferent servers that this charmed me to no end. \\n\\nOur meal was fantastic, and a bargain, just under $30 for the two of us, including my tasty 16 oz. Modelo.

It was the first restaurant I remember... My father worked here back when it was only a function hall and I remember sitting at a table, helping him with folding napkins on a sleepy Sunday afternoon, the room lit by paper and wooden lanterns with intricate carvings adorning the large chamber. Now, it's a bit different in its incarnation ever since the 1980's heralded in the age of dim sum spreading around. The place is still called China Pearl, but different in Chinese. The wood is gone, replaced by mirrors and bright lights. I have to wear my sunglasses or eyepatch whenever I am in there as a result. Many familiar faces have worked there and moved on over the years, but it is still a nexus of Chinatown. China Pearl is still a safe bet as a restaurant to take guests who have never tried dim sum before, but I presently find the quality a bit better at Windsor across the street and Hei La Moon. It has diminished a bit and could give itself a facelift in its operations, having barely changing such in twenty years. It's a place I've introduced many a person to dim sum to, and it is definitely a love-hate thing.\\n\\nFor dim sum, the optimum time to go there is about 10 AM, when enough time has passed that all the carts are circulating, but not before it starts dying down... as well as the selection. I'm afraid the quality of the ha gao (shrimp dumplings) has diminished a bit over the years. When they first converted, there was a lot more bamboo shoots in comparison to the shrimp. Now, there's barely, if any at all. Chinese cuisine is about complements of flavors, and the delicate bamboo offset that of the shrimp, the stereotypical yin-yang taking place. I wish they would go back to the old recipe... The Siu Mai (pork/shrimp dumplings) are alright, more complementary than the ha gao. At least with dim sum, you can see the dishes as they come around here and just... pick away at whatever looks good that day. What is usually a limited offering is the 'zia leurng', a fried Chinese cruller wrapped in rice noodles that contain cilantro, topped by a sweetened soy sauce. If you see it on top of the cart that has the other rice noodle dishes, grab one before they all go away. They only make a small quantity each day, mostly due to the cilantro wrapping. Ordering off the menu, they do a yin yang fried rice alright. It is a bed of fried rice with egg, and bean sprouts, topped on one side by chicken and onions in a sweetened tomato sauce and shrimp with peas in a white egg drop sauce. \\n\\nIf you are curious as to the level of 'Fear Factor' foods there are here, the worst you will find are the tripe (available at the hot food bar), the chicken talons (fong zao), and the thousand year old egg soup (pei dan jook). It's not as frightening as other places in Chinatown where you can find such dishes as ox tongue with coagulated pig's blood.\\n\\nAlso, if you want a hint for parking on weekends, if you don't mind dealing with walking half a mile, I park at the street that's normally tour bus parking during weekdays next to the Herald and can readily find parking until about 1 pm.\\n\\nDishes to try: \\" Zia Leurng\\" (rice noodle wrapped around fried cruller), Siu Mai, Yin Yang fried rice"},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Beautiful view.

But Punjabi Dhaba does a very good job in sticking to the orginal flavors and spice levels as one would find if you were traveling to India, which I enjoyed very much.

This past Saturday my two friends and I came to Mother's for lunch. The restaurant was recommended to us by a tour guide who offers a \\"free\\" tour of Portland. At any rate, we arrived around 1pm and the place was packed. The waitress said it would be around 30minute wait- but we were seated within 20 minutes or so! \\n\\nThe Server:\\nFor the life of me, I cannot remember our waitress' name- she had shoulder length hair, a larger healthier frame and she seemed to know a lot about the menu. Her service was terrible. She never clearly answered our questions about pricing, was exceptionally dismissive and intentionally misleading. My friend inquired about the price to substitute macaroni with her lunch special and the waitress said - \\"don't worry, I'll take care of it\\". To me, and the rest of the civilized world, that means - I won't charge, or it will be a minimal charge etc. The bill came out and the substituted  macaroni side was $7.00 up charge WTF?? \\n\\nThe Food: \\nI ordered the $50,000 crab cake sandwiches - what a joke. 2 fried balls of bacon and filler featuring selected \\"nibbles\\" of crab. I also got the \\"weekend\\" mac and cheese- bowtie pasta, bacon, sour cream and cheddar. Sounds like it would have been great- except they rationed out the actual cheese- so all I got was al dente yet dry bowtie pasta with bits of bacon - I asked them to hold the sour cream. \\nMy friends both got the fried snapper sandwich on \\"country bread\\". Which, the waitress went out of her way to \\"inform\\" us that country bread was upgraded, thicker sliced white bread LOL - Thanks for the helpful tidbit. \\nWell, this country bread was a poor choice for such a flaky fish like fried snapper. My friends said all they tasted was bread- as it overpowered the thin pieces of fish. Perhaps a softer variety of bread would be better for snapper. \\nMy friends both got the broccoli mac and cheese which they both found disappointing- again, lots of pasta and broccoli with occasional tastes of cheese.

It was about 45 minutes when we got there; that's not bad for a Friday night, and it was a lot longer for people who arrived after that. \\n\\nWe got a second floor table and it looked out onto the lagoon in the middle of CityWalk which made for a nice atmosphere. Our waiter took the time to explain items on the menu and some house favorites, and was very nice. \\n\\nWe had the cheesesteak eggrolls to start. Good appetizer, about what you'd expect if you have had them before, but the cherry pepper dipping sauce elevated them. We had the gnocchi and the Blue Plate burger, which has a burger patty with a slice of meatloaf, cheddar, mashed potatoes and gravy and corn on top. It's a big burger but pretty easy to eat once you push down on the bun and squish the potatoes. Very flavorful and juicy, and the fries were good too. The gnocchi was really good and cooked perfectly, but the chocolate mole sauce was outstanding. \\n\\nWe had a little room left and got milkshakes, which are the most talked about item on the menu. They didn't disappoint; the dessert on top (we got the chocolate banana shake and the chocolate strawberry one) was tasty and not overly sweet. The milkshakes were a little thinner than most but they were easy to drink and tasted good, not like the 'concretes' a lot of other places have. \\n\\nOverall, it was a nice dinner and one of the better theme park dining experiences. The entree prices were reasonable, but thought the appetizers could be a bit cheaper. The shakes run about $10-12 but they are a signature item and worth trying at least once. The only real disappointment (although I won't factor it into rating the dining experience) is the gift shop and the prices. Most of the items were way overpriced. Example: $14 for a mason jar of cotton candy or a small chocolate bar smaller than a movie theatre sized one. We did try the truffles (which were $2.95 each) and they were good and had unique flavors, but you are better off just waiting for dessert in the restaurant. \\n\\nI would go back and try some other menu items just because a lot of them sounded really good and it was hard to narrow it down.

We had three specials--two early bird with strip steak and one daily special with ribeye and a few shrimp. All came with bread, soup or salad, and a side. The early bird specials even came with the dessert of the day (delicious carrot cake on the day we went).   We didn't see the 11.99 deal on the menu. Maybe we just didn't look in the right place.  However, I felt that my 14.99 early bird special was well worth it, and my husband agreed about his 21.99 ribeye deal. My only complaint is that I don't think they really weigh the steaks.

Unfortunately, or possibly fortunately, I'm not one of them. In the end, most of the food was reasonable for the price point; however, several aspects of the dining experience were simply bizarre.\\n\\nFood: The menu at Capozzi's is comprised of standard Americanized \\"red sauce\\" Italian fare. During my visit, my dining partner and I started with the gorgonzola mac n' cheese and an order of the garlic bread with mozzarella. The mac n' cheese was exceptional, but the garlic bread was cold and unimpressive. For an entree, I opted for the chicken parmesan, which I always order during a first time visit to an Italian restaurant so that I have a universal standard with which to compare to competitors. That being said, the dish was edible, but by no means memorable. They also charged an additional $3 for substituting butter instead of tomato sauce on the accompanying side of pasta; I'm still perplexed by that one. For dessert, I opted for a mini cannolo and the hazelnut gelato, both of which were flavorful.\\n\\nService: Pleasant and attentive. Upon entry, we were promptly greeted and the waiter arrived shortly thereafter. The turnaround time between order and delivery was exceptionally quick; we were ushered through drinks, appetizers, dinner, and dessert in less than an hour.\\n\\nAtmosphere: I was less than impressed with the ambience of this place.

This is the closest hotel to this event where it is just a short walk. Arrived at the hotel where I read reviews better to valet your vehicle except the valet lot is outdoors and self parking is in a garage.  If you self park then you have a long walk to the lobby so I chose valet.  No problems with that and the weather was clear of thunderstorms.\\n\\nI checked in on my phone earlier but still had to wait in line where other hotels like Omni has a little area to pickup you room key and some newer ones allows you to use your phone as the key where both allows you to bypass the registration desk.  I did not wait long and got my hotel 4th of July itinerary. This is a standard design Hyatt hotel where you have an huge enclosed atrium. Up went in glass elevators with birds eye view of the lobby.\\n\\nI have recently been inside the hotel lobby where an extensive remodel was done and now the bar is really nice with lots of seating.\\n\\nAs I approached the room it had a glowing display on it showing the room number.  I thought at first would have my name on it and looked very futuristic seeing them next to every door on the 14th floor. There was also a doorbell.  \\n\\nAs I opened the door I was engulfed in a major upgrade to this older hotel.  It pretty much had the same ultra modern decor as the Hyatt Savannah.  I was impressed!  The room had a large LCD display, mini fridge to store drinks, two free water bottles, king bed, view of the lake and downtown, and two bath robes.  This room had a walk-in huge shower with no tub. All the lights were already on to avoid entering a dark room. Everything worked and no room issues at all.\\n\\nOur first job was to hang out at the pool.  So we changed and headed back to the lobby. We found the pool and not impressed.  It was rather small and extremely over crowded.  Luckily we found one open chair to put our stuff on.  This pool is dated and would like to see Hyatt redo it by claiming part of the valet parking lot.  But Hyatt does it best by having hosts walk around to serve food and drinks.  There is a small area next to the pool where they make burgers and a small bar. Towels are provided and did feel nice in the pool.  There is also a spa next to pool too. One hint is you do not have to close out your tab where they will automatically add 20% tip and close it out for you.\\n\\nAfter swimming we headed back to our room to get ready for dinner.  We avoided to fajita buffet where we did not want to eat a lot of food so we headed to the bar.  It was packed so decided go outside which turned out to be another restaurant.  It was nice where it was covered and with live music.  We a had a great waitress bring us food and drinks.  The chips and queso we had had was good.\\n\\nAfterwards we walked to the park to enjoy the festivities and fireworks.  After I noticed pretty much everyone staying here went to see the fireworks so the elevators was congested where everyone was trying to go up.  Some were walking up to the second level in order to get on elevator going down.  We waited about 30 minutes in the lobby until it was clear.\\n\\nThe next morning we checked out and was greeted by a tall cowboy (official Hyatt greeter) at the entrance. He wished us well and hope we return, and we will."},{"name":"Rookies Cantina","address":"140 South Highway 17-92","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"So so disappointed.

Therefore, this is one offer I seldom turn down and was more than pleased (all libido puns aside) to have been invited to dinner at this charming establishment that I have strolled past on sundry occasions, but never wandered in.  \\n\\nFrom the outside looking in, Hannibal's is very reminiscent of an attractive little European, or more appropriately, French restaurant.  It sort of architecturally reeks of pompousness and its interior is reflective of what could only be apropos for its type of cuisine; pretentious decor.  Not to be misunderstood, these are two things which I thoroughly enjoy and it isn't at all in my opinion negative traits, but rather in accordance with my expectations hence my loving of it all.\\n\\nThe restaurant is adjoined by Chez Vincent which its decor is a far cry from Hannibal's Lounge.  It is analogous to having a [very clean] 1990s Kia dealership sharing a connected hotel room with a 2000s BMW dealership.  I don't know about you, but that seemed like an accurate comparison at the time.  The Lounge offers a beautiful bar that is inviting of great conversations and cocktails.  However, since it is so far from the main drag at Park Avenue, it lacks a bit in human traffic which could be a plus for some.  At first glance, it seemed like most of its clientele were return customers or friends of the Chef.  The available seating ranges from regular chairs, to therapist like love chairs and interesting chairs that forces one to maintain good posture due to the lacking proximity of any back cushion.  All extremely charming.\\n\\nSo aside from expecting to have my order taken by a therapist while I lied down and vented my day's frustrations, we were greeted by a nice hostess who proceeded to tells us about the specials and hand us the cocktail and wine lists.  Also, bread is served with a small variety of special butters that are made in house.\\n\\nService was extremely prompt and courteous.  No issues were had there, there were two gentlemen providing covers of famous 90s songs which was a nice surprise.  Although at times it seemed to be a bit loud for the rather confined area of the restaurant, it was fine overall and actually entertaining.  \\n\\nRight away glasses of wine were ordered and the mention of a foie gras appetizer immediately caught my attention.  In other words, it was ordered in haste.  It arrived beautifully set up (and in good timing) as it can be seen in my photo of it.  The foie gras tasted great and the texture was very good as well, not extremely fatty either which was nice.  Coupled with the apples and the reduction sauce it made for a marvelous intro to what came next.\\n\\nMy main entr√©e was also another special, after mentally wrestling with wanting Venison, the Veal Chop was the clear winner when the tummy bell rang.  It was a nice piece covered by a peppercorn cognac sauce accompanied by mashed potatoes and some vegetables (see my photo).  Overall, a very great dish.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place for a nice romantic date or business dinner and drinks.  Far away enough from the crowds on Park Avenue, it makes for a good place to actually chat without having to scream over other patrons and the bar is just so darn gorgeous that it's worth a visit.  So make your way down and venture out of the main area of Winter Park and stroll down NE Ave. for a nice quiet and tastefully loud surprise!\\n\\nAu revoir!"},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great service, cute decor and good food!

What's nice about the fact that their brunch is on Sundays is that parking is free and Sunday brunches are usually (at least from my experience) a lot more laid back than brunch any other day of the week. \\n\\nBefore I get into the food, let me say that the only hiccup in our visit was the fact that they have this policy about only being allowed to eat at a table if you are ordering their $25 all you can eat barbecue. You are limited to only eating at the bar if you are ordering off their Sunday brunch A-La-Cart menu. My friends weren't taking that one bit so they managed to talk the manager into letting us eat at their outside patio - especially because there weren't that many people dining that day. I do think that they should tweak their policy a bit because they only serve their brunch on Sundays and I can imagine that others would want more seating options when they come for that.\\n\\nAnyways, moving on, once we were seated, we were greeted by one of the sweetest waitresses I think I've ever had for brunch. She was really patient with us (even though her shift was supposed to end soon), explained everything thoroughly, and gave us recommendations. We all went with mimosas to start off with, my friends ordered two benedicts each (both the lambo's and the hanger steak) and I got the frito pie. My friends loved the benedicts. Actually I think they couldn't finish them fast enough - they were that good! As for me, my Frito pie provided this unique sense of happiness that I don't think any meal has ever done quite like this one did. The frito pie is a mixture of chopped beef, queso, ch√®vre, pico, and poached egg. All the ingredients come together beautifully and what really stands out is the leading taste of sweetness, the texture of tender meats, balanced with the slightly salty ch√®vre and pico. Every bite that I took was like reliving the first one - and the meal as a whole could not have been made any better. \\n\\nAs we ate, our waitress was very attentive and friendly towards us and reassured us that we should take our time as we ate - even when it was getting close to time for the kitchen to close up for brunch, and the restaurant as a whole to close up shop to prepare for dinner.

They could serve nothing but cannoli and they would still be worthy of five solid stars. Simply put, the experience of consuming Mike's Italian yellow cream cannoli is sheer bliss. As in, BETTER THAN SEX. Forget the pills; Mike's cannoli are the only antidepressants you need. In my 25 years on this earth I have not found a more decadent treat. They are always optimally fresh -- they go like hotcakes, how could they not be? -- which makes for the best crust I have ever encountered. Light and flaky, just as it should be.\\n\\nWhile I am partial to the yellow cream flavor, the hazelnut is almost equally as good, the original ricotta is great, and the pistachio is delicious as well. I had never tried pistachio-flavored sweets before I tried Mike's pistachio cannoli (cannolo?). I was surprised to find that the pistachio flavor wasn't overwhelming at all. I'm not a fan of chocolate so I can't comment on the chocolate flavors, but my friend always gets them and concurs that they are also orgasmic.\\n\\nAs for their other pastries, the tiramisu is the best I've ever had: not overly coffee-flavored and not too sweet with a delicate texture. HOWEVER, I would recommend not bothering with the pies. The apple pie was mediocre at best. I probably could have gotten a similar pie from a grocery store bakery. The crust was too hard (not fresh) and the filling wasn't sweet enough for my liking.\\n\\nA word to the wise: make note of the sign on the door that specifically says NOT to form a single-file line out the door. When in Boston, do as the Bostonians do: waste no time and push your way to the front. Walk in, obtain cannoli, walk out with your little blue and white box, and get on with your day.

It comes with strips of Lamb Bacon, an egg, roasted tomato, grilled organic greens & pickled vegetables on a Fluer de Lis Potato Roll.  All I will say is \\"this is not your mothers average Bacon & tomato sandwich\\".  As my Jewish Grandmother used to say \\"Try it you'll like it\\"  I would say \\"try it you'll love it\\".

Our waiter, Ian, attended to us right away which is always a plus in my book.  \\n\\nWhile perusing the menu, we discussed what type of fusion this place constitutes...I'm not sure if we ever actually figured it out...Hawaiian with something.  I decided on the oriental chicken salad, consisting of cabbage, almonds, chives, a sweet dressing, and of course the chicken.  It was delicious, I ate almost all of it...a rare feat for me at a restaurant.  My only problem with it was that towards the bottom, it got really, really soggy.  Too much dressing.  Ian addressed this issue in his spiel about the place only having been open for a week and needing to \\"work out some kinks,\\" as John so elegantly put it.\\n\\nThe dish timing was pretty terrible, actually.

I sent out messages to about 20 restaurants and The Oasis event staff was the easiest to work with. They immediately reached out and sent me an email with all of the information laid out. They gave me a lot to work with on a menu and let me customize exactly what I wanted as long as I reached the minimum per person. I got the Lone Star Room with a private balcony at sunset and the views were STUNNING. The Oasis staff did a wonderful job providing my linens of choice and having fresh flower centerpieces on each table. We had a private bar and bartender for my guests. They also have a sound system and a way to show a slideshow to your guests. While there they were able to accommodate adding a few extra food selections on the spot. It was the easiest experience when it came to wedding planning. It was all taken care of for me and they were more than happy to do it. I highly recommend for a couple looking for a rehearsal dinner space. You already have so much to figure out, this should be the easy part. I should also add that they are on top of their security. We had a random party crasher that was an issue and we had a police officer present within five minutes. My guests were not disturbed and it was handled discreetly.

Don't let any of these other reviews that are giving this good reviews fool you, this is by far the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life.  The quality of the food was absolutely awful.  There was only a few things on the \\"buffet\\" that had any taste to them at all.

The employees there were rude in telling my party that we were not allowed to eat in the restaurant because we arrived during the last half hour of the business' operating hours.\\n\\nFor an analogy, most fast food restaurants display hours when their dining area is closed and their drive-thru is the only area open.

This business could take some note of this, and operate their business in a similar way.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I didn't order any of their food due to their attitude leaving a bad taste for food I haven't even ordered yet.

Not knowing where to eat, we stumbled upon this little Chinese restaurant called China Pearl. Being Chinese and having eaten burgers and fries the whole week, we had a huge craving for Chinese food so we went to check it out. \\n\\nWe ended up ordering Yang Chow Fried Rice, House Special Fried Noodles, Mongolian Beef, House Chicken, Seafood Delight, and Salt and Pepper Spareribs. The food was just horrible. Mongolian Beef was not even close to being Mongolian Beef. It was just beef with onions and green onions in oyster sauce with a weird taste. The seafood delight had a really strong fishy smell, like they used frozen or dead seafood. The total bill came out to be a little over $100.\\n\\nNormally, I have no problem tipping 18-20% for great food and service. However, when the food is horrible and they decide to add the 18% gratuity to our bill of only 5 people, that's just wrong. They even charged us more for the House Special Fried Noodles. Their excuse was that the prices on the to go menus were cheaper than their dine-in menus."},{"name":"Parma Trattoria & Mozzarella Bar","address":"1132 W Dillon Rd","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"The food here is really delicious.

I prefer more crispy skin, but that could be a matter of preference. There aren't options to just have chicken only without sides and there aren't any options with regard to sides.

Lattes are an exact science so it might have thrown off the drink just enough. Although I felt I did not get Timbertrain's best, it was still good.

I hate these types of situations.  People who arrived after us were able to sit before us because it was a free for all situation.  That's okay in some circumstances but if you're a restaurant with high-priced food and fancy surroundings, you need a hostess.  I cannot stress that enough.  So anyway, my group of four was finally seated in the corner at a community table.  We waited for what felt like an unreasonable amount of time before someone noticed us and brought us menus and filled our water glasses.\\n\\nBecause it was so very dark in this restaurant, we had to use our phones to light up the menus in order to see what we were ordering.  Additionally, the elevator music they were playing was at a volume so high that we couldn't hear one another speak and our waiter couldn't hear us to take our orders.  My friend aptly called it \\"The Helen Keller Dining Experience.\\"  We couldn't see or hear anything!  It was awful.\\n\\nThe beer prices are a little ridiculous ($7 for a short glass) and their cocktail menu wasn't impressive but the wine selection was pretty decent.  The food menu was just sad.  Only seven items to choose from!  There really wasn't anything I wanted on the menu but I went ahead and ordered the $14 burger anyway.  The $14 burger that was very good but came with zero sides.  I suppose for an additional $5 I could have ordered the fries but after seeing how small the $5 cheese biscuits my friend ordered were, I am glad I opted out.  My boyfriend got the spicy chicken sandwich which he said was good but again just not fulfilling.  We all left pretty hungry.  The desserts looked okay but by then we just wanted to get out of the restaurant so we could see and hear again.  \\n\\nThe service was mediocre.  Like I said, our waiter could not hear us but he also told us he didn't know how to turn down the music so we were left shouting at one another.  I realize that they just opened and have some kinks to work out and I am hoping that they will improve over time but they have a long way to go.  I will also say that the upgrades done to the building from it's last status as World of Beer are super swanky and the building itself is just gorgeous.  We also really liked the nice cutlery that came with our meals and my burger was really tasty!  Just not $14 with no sides tasty...\\n\\nSo RT is a no from me.

My boyfriend is military disabled, and has a handicap tag. The \\"gentlemen\\"  was reluctant to hear us- until I finally told him that we were going to valet the car with or without his instruction. He also had our elderly relatives shuttle- once they were denied and told to pull around.\\n\\nI was not impressed- The food was cold- mushy and tasteless. The person carving the turkey did not know how to properly carve- The serving containers for these items, their lids were left open. Nothing was kept warm. The serving utensils were cacked with layers of food. Imagine trying to get a serving of mashed potatoes, with a spoon that felt like it was layered in concrete. The gravy was kept in a tea like container w a ladle- and we all know what happens with gravy once it decreases in temperature. The turkey was dry, and almost tasted like it was from a frozen bird VS a fresh turkey. The desserts were cold and looked to be bulk bought. We even asked if the pie could be warmed and we were told that their \\"broilers\\" weren't on. The oysters were watery and phlegm like in texture. The prime rib was very fatty and very, very rare, causing me to have to take a Phenergan later that evening. I wouldn't be surprised if other customers also felt sick after eating here. \\n\\nAfter spending $240+ dollars for a family of 5- we would much rather have gone to Cracker Barrel and had a warm meal. Half of the items on the Thanksgiving 2017 menu- weren't even out for presentation. I've never been a fan of buffets- and after seeing other customers hand grab items. It would have been better to have servers at the line serving people- decreasing the chaotic feel of this \\"4.3 *,\\" establishment . We were placed in the back of the restaurant where tables were literally within inches of one another. It was like entering a maze to get from one side of the restaurant to the other. The sun was shining in all its glory- which made eating difficult. In the future, save your money, time and taste buds. Golden Coral puts on a better experience and meal. \\n\\nThis venue could not keep up with the quantity of its patrons- and it was directly reflected in the quality of the food. We missed out on our Thanksgiving this year. We all were very disappointed and will all share our experience w friends and family. DO NOT GO HERE. Everyone from that day should get their money back and a sincere apology from management. I was eager to tell a  friend of mine who is a food blogger/critic for Atlanta Magazine.

I wasn't going to bother - after leaving, I reckoned I ought to let bygones be bygones, all's well that ends well, whatever doesn't kill me, etc. But then the hotel sent me a survey, and I realized by the time I got to the short-essay section that I was far from the acceptance portion of the grief cycle.\\n\\nI was introduced to the Millennium by a friend who was getting married and who made the grave error of booking a room and reserving a room block here. I stayed in a room with the maid-of-honor.\\n\\nA quick review of the bride's misfortunes: She wasn't given the room that she had seen during a tour. This new room had a stunning and up-close view of a ventilation apparatus that provided deafening white noise throughout her stay. \\n\\nThis room also had exactly two mirrors. Now, I'm a guy, but I've witnessed enough girls getting ready to know that four bridesmaids plus one bride plus two mothers multiplied by a wedding equals more than two mirrors. Ah, said some representative of the hotel at a preliminary point of the proceedings, but we will bring in another mirror. By the time of the wedding, this mirror had been broken and the woman who had promised it had quit.\\n\\nIndeed, as my friend planned her wedding, she learned that turnover at the Millennium is unusually high. One can hardly blame the fortunate employees who escape their entanglement with this hotel.\\n\\nMy own experiences are of the same character, although not of the same degree, as the bride's. Our shower didn't drain properly, as other reviews have noted. The light switches and one of the electric plugs didn't work. The doors had a curious security feature; they never opened before the third attempt, and in order to close them, one had to give it a slam that echoed throughout the hotel and shook nearby room. \\n\\nThe hotel, we were told, had been recently renovated. The renovations seem not to extend to the 70s-chic carpeting and tenement-style structural solidness.\\n\\nAs a side note, I learned a bit of the colorful local Colorado patois while at the Millennium. \\"Doors are locked for the security of our guests\\" means roughly \\"Doors are unlocked and frequently propped open,\\" and while no exact standard English equivalent exists for \\"Emergency exit,\\" it's close to \\"Door is hermetically and permanently sealed.\\"\\n\\nBut I doubt I would have responded to the survey or written this review if it weren't for an incident on the last afternoon of our stay. After a day spent returning the mirror I had to grab from the bride's house to make up for the deficiencies of her room, the maid-of-honor and I found some lunch in a nearby strip mall and decided to sit outside in the hotel's courtyard out back. Now, this courtyard is quite lovely and has three distinct areas: a lawn complete with festive families playing volleyball; a fenced-off patio with tables and chairs that is clearly for those dining at the restaurant; and a bit of concrete with tables and chairs that, we assumed, was a common area. It was here that we sat.\\n\\nA manager soon dispelled these wild, far-fetched ideas we had of enjoying the property that we had paid well above average local rates to occupy. He told us that we were on private property on which outside food was not allowed. We said we were guests and were told that we could eat in the courtyard so long as we submitted to the highway robbery that is daily perpetrated inside the restaurant.\\n\\nA note about the restaurant: While I did not eat there, I did sit at the table of the bride and her grandmother as the latter was served, not the dish she had ordered, but one that the waiter found to be close enough. The dish was served a la carte, without the side order of apology that is so frequently served at other restaurants that make similar errors.\\n\\nNow, I don't think of myself as an unreasonable man. Frankly, I'm willing to put up with quite a lot of human failing, particularly on the part of service workers. But to every limit, there is a limit. \\n\\nI wouldn't return to this hotel to please a dying uncle."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Our first time in Boston and we couldn't pass not going to this place as we saw that there long lines yet everyone seemed so exited in buying cannoli.

We were originally going to Quoc Huong in Asian Square, but they were out of bread (thanks to Zack E. for jogging my memory on this), so we headed over to Lee's instead.  Since then, I've gone back to Lee's many times when I have a hankering for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches).  The sandwiches are inexpensive (only $2.50 or $3.00 per) and they are quite yummy and filling.\\n\\nLee's biggest competitor is probably Quoc Huong up the street.  The biggest differences I've noticed between the two stores are: (1) Lee's owner and staff are friendlier, (2) the inside of Lee's is cleaner, and (3) the banh mi at Quoc Huong uses a lot more butter.  That's not to put down Quoc Huong though, because both restaurants make very good banh mi.\\n\\nYou can get all sorts of meat inside your banh mi from Lee's.  This includes everything from chicken and pork to head cheese.  I actually like the banh mi with head cheese at Lee's.  To be honest, I have no idea what exactly goes into their head cheese.  It's just a tasty Vietnamese cold cut to me!  The rest of the sandwich ingredients include cilantro, pickled carrots, cucumbers, and fresh jalapenos, all inside a thick, crispy French baguette.\\n\\nLee's sells all of these ingredients separately so you can make your own banh mi at home.  Great for families and people who know how to make banh mi.  I tried to do it myself once and the results were not so good.  I think I will stick with having Lee's make them for me.  The ingredients are fresh, including the bread, which they bake themselves.  It smells so good when they are unleashing a new batch.\\n\\nLaura W. asked me how Lee's makes any money if the sandwiches are so inexpensive.  I'm not sure, but my guess is volume.  I've seen some customers come in here and buy 20 sandwiches at a time.  They stuff them in brown paper bags (like the ones you can get at grocery stores) to go.  Anthony N. informs me that Lee's is a large national chain and they make quite a bit of profit based on volume.\\n\\nThe store also sells a variety of Vietnamese drinks and sweet snacks, which you can find in the refrigerators near the cash register.  The store isn't too big, but there's usually available seating inside.  They've got a big TV in one corner.  They accept credit card, but there is a $10 minimum which can be hard to reach at a place like this!\\n\\n#Yelp365 - 26/365"},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Best happy hour ever!\\nThe sushi is amazing (even better at half price!) and the calamari is to die to.

Bonus: They also care about their neighbors' well-being as much as their own (See their Instagram.)\\n\\nThe Food: I've ordered everything off the menu by now and haven't been disappointed. For me, sharing an assorted dozen with one friend is perfect. The chai flight is definitely more than my friend and I could polish off, but the flavors were so yummy, it didn't matter!\\n\\nThe Service: On my first visit, I was intimidated by the line reaching nearly to the door. But even with newbie jitters, I was happily surprised how calm and helpful the cashier was in helping me decide on my order combination. So even though I had decided to pick up a dozen on my way to Olympia, the staff was so efficient, I was in and out within ten minutes! \\n\\nBottom line: The whole menu is tasty. The people are lovely. The space is clean and cozy. Clearly, I'm now addicted."},{"name":"Cambridge Common","address":"1667 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Beer was good, food was decent, and they have a nice patio.

I told them I was new to Austin and missed my Peruvian friends back home and they were so welcoming. \\n\\nOnto the food, it is so delicious and makes me nostalgic. They have empanadas and alfajores for a quick bite, but my go-to meal here is the tallarin verde. Back at their highland location it wasn't on the menu but the owner would make it if someone ordered. Now it's one of their house specials! The sauce is perfection, great for cold days. If you like more meat, have the lomo saltado! In fact, have anything here, I've taken lots of friends and everyone has left full and happy.

Not having worked in Manhattan for a bit now, I have really been craving the freshness that Sweetgreen provides. \\nI found this location to be clean and had a lot of seating options. Granted, I did go in the evening so the lunch scene may attract a different crowd.\\nI ordered the Curry Cauliflower - which has organic arugula, warm quinoa, curry-roasted cauliflower, cilantro, shredded cabbage, roasted chicken, raisins, sweetgreen hot sauce, cucumber tahini yogurt dressing ($10.10). They originally made the salad incorrectly, but quickly tossed it and restarted without any hesitation - which was greatly appreciated. Everything in my salad was very fresh and it was prepared extremely quick, even with having to create a whole second salad. All orders do come with an option for a side of bread. I also ordered an unsweetened Jasmine Green Iced Tea - this was just like slightly flavored water. However, you can refill as often as you'd like. \\nI do like the option to pay right from the app - which awards you points that comes with certain perks depending on your status.

My room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was spacious. The service at the front desk was very good and the workers were quite pleasant.

The mole and cheese enchiladas have cheese on top. Every single time I've ever ordered these, except for tonight, the cheese is melted gooey. Tonight the cheese hadn't melted at all. I thought that was odd until I bit into the enchilada. Stone cold. Seriously? How does that happen? Were these in a refrigerator or something? \\n\\nWe ordered 4 entrees.

I then had calamari.....VAN D KAMPS....literally from the box, and not even refried to get some oil...these were 5 day old calamari reheated in microwave.

I agree with Mickey in that the atmosphere feels rather stale...but I found it more to be confusing...everyone, everything, the food, etc... just a little confusing.  I compare this to be similar to the non-italian pizza joints around Boston...these places seem to have about 1000 different things on their menu...but they claim to be a pizza joint.  You can have Hamburgers, Wings, Falafel, Hummus, Gyro, Schwarma, steak bombs, phillies, and PIZZA.

I must say I'm not very original and always get the same thing, but the filet is excellent quality and cooked as ordered. I add a blue cheese crust -- delectable!  My favorite thing has to be the truffle blue cheese macaroni and cheese.  The flavors are beautiful. We also tried the tuna takaki, which was high quality and very good -- if a bit small for three to share, so we also got another appetizer, but whatever it was, fades in my memory to the tuna.

It was surprise -- because after all I've heard about Mike's Pastry all these years, in my mind I'd pictured a large, bustling establishment with long banks of packed display cases. It's not, it's tiny! One somewhat small L-shaped display case and a modest assortment. Can't fit more than two or three people behind there. I like that -- it evokes a personal feeling that you only get from the specialty, boutique places.\\n\\nClearly they're known for their cannoli, as they occupied almost one whole case. They offer a decent assortment of flavors including chocolate, chocolate chip, and strawberry. Don't tell my ancestry, but cannoli has never been my favorite. Too much sweet cream and I never liked the way the shell shatters. So I haven't tried the cannoli. I'm sure it's great, but I'm just not a fan.\\n\\nCookies, turtles, tarts, bear claws -- all looked delicious. I chose a big chocolate brownie out of all the brownie choices (the peanut butter one almost got me). My husband chose a large oversized peanut butter cup, and a Boston Cream puff of some kind. \\n\\nDelightful, truly.\\n\\nWhen I say the brownie is big, I should clarify: it's HUGE.

First things first, the outside is deceiving in relation to layout and size. This place has several different sections creating an overall open atmosphere housing a bar area, lounge sitting, dining area, bocce ball court and an open air brewing area. It is a really well laid out area that flows through out. I went for Sunday Funday and while the place was not packed, there were enough people in each section to see the full possibility of the place. \\n\\nI bellied up to the bar; and began rummaging through their expansive list of beers, most of which were bottled/cans, with a few on tap. One things that was nice is that they seem to be really true to the area highlighting a lot of local beers! Food wise, the menu featured several bar friendly snacks from Duck fat chex mix to salt and vinegar pork rings with hot sauce. They did have a full menu with \\"bigs\\" or entrees, sandwiches and even \\"pies\\" or pizza as we more so call it here in the south. I was just in a snacky mood, but if I had not been I would have definitely gone for the shrimp burger...it sounded just divine! I ended up getting a couple of sides...the BBQ tater tots with the house made green ranch and the broccoli/bacon mac n cheese. Both were wonderful. The mac n cheese was surprisingly good with broccoli mixed in the dish. I like to think of myself as a tot aficionado and these tots were on par with great things. They were lightly dusted with a BBQ seasoning and sided with the green ranch. The green ranch was a little runny and did not quite do it for me, however one of the waiters suggested I try their house made kimchi ketchup with them and BAM! Just DO IT! If you the tots, ask for this sided with them and thank me later! \\n\\nOn a separate visit, I had the ribs that are listed on the appetizer menu and HOLY JEEZ were they amazing. The sriracha glaze and slice peppers were just the start. The ribs were literally fall off the bone with the right amount of heat and yummy-ness.

The green was basically semipureed chiles and the habanero had a little kick but was watery.\\n\\nThe price was right and probably one of the reasons it is inviting but with several really good food carts here, I'm not quite sure how it survives other than there isn't any other Mexican food in the immediate vicinity.\\n\\nSimply, if you want a good amount of food for your dollar, than you will do good here but just know that there is great Mexican food in Portland."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I ordered the impossible burger.

If we had not been with friends, we might not have lasted the night.\\n\\nAsian Gourmet was this year's choice for our annual Chinese restaurant pilgrimage on Christmas Eve.  We had eaten lunch there in the past, and reviews in Yelp suggested that it was the best in Acton.  So why not give it a try to see if it could fare better than the slimy Americanized food at Yangtze River in Littleton?\\n\\nWe arrived in time for our 7 PM reservation and stood in the entranceway for 10 minutes until a table opened.  It was one of those convertible tables with four fold-out flaps to give just enough room for seven midgets, and we were planted on the main thoroughfare from the kitchen and in close proximity to the entranceway we had just left.   It was as calm as an afternoon siesta in the middle of Penn Station.\\n\\nWhat made our meal truly unique this particular evening was the service.  It was a true caricature of traditional Chinese restaurant hospitality, even though this restaurant is supposed to be Taiwanese.  It was a struggle to get water and tea cups for everyone.  For some reason, we needed to ask three times to get everyone covered only to hear a waiter ask \\"How many cups do you want?\\"  Two of the ice waters collapsed due to the instability of the table leaves, and a waiter 'came to our aid' by tossing a white gym towel for us to clean the mess.  Meanwhile, amidst the chaos, someone else delivered one small dish of peanuts and another of pickled cabbage to share seven ways (I wonder how many guests would have justified a second dish), while a kettle of tea appeared out of nowhere, too.  Those who poured themselves were disappointed to see slightly tinted water.  We were initially advised that it was normal green tea, but the waiter eventually bowed to the unmistakable reality of having served us hot dishwater by adding a second tea bag to what had miraculously become Jasmine tea.  When we asked for forks, a waitress returned with a potpourri of mismatched utensils and plopped them in front of me to distribute.  There was implied pressure to order quickly, as the waiter hung over the table while we tried to choose dishes from a 16 page menu.  We had to share, because - just as for the water and tea -not everybody earned the right to a menu, and one lucky diner was limited to the sushi selections from the restaurant upstairs.  The waitress was disinterested when we told her about the mismatch and simply returned the Japanese menu into the pile for its next unsuspecting victim.\\n\\nIn all fairness, the food was actually quite good.  We had Saut√©ed String Beans, Chinese Eggplant in Garlic Sauce, Home Style Fried Tofu with Mixed Vegetables, House Special Rice Cake, as well as brown and white rice.  But the dishes were served with the grace of an Austrian avalanche, and nobody ever returned to see if the food was to our satisfaction, refill our waters, clean our table, take desert orders, or deliver our check.  At Asian Gourmet, you basically need to ask for everything.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes of friendly post-meal discussion, we requested our bill.  Only then did the obligatory fortune cookies arrive as a hand delivered dump - unfortunate since fortunes are often a fun topic of conversation.  At the same time, the waitress awkwardly wished us happy \\"birthday\\" then shifted her table cleaning prowess into high gear as we tried to share our fortunes and put on coats.  Whatever happened to clearing dirty dishes as soon as patrons finish the meal or after they vacate the restaurant?\\n\\nWill we return?  Perhaps for lunch when there is less strain on what we might euphemistically call a 'delicate delivery system'.  But as far as dinners are concerned, unless the staff takes a few lessons in service etiquette from an accredited junior college, the Asian Gourmet restaurant is - until further notice - hereby strictly recommended for take-out only."},{"name":"Ray Ray's Hog Pit","address":"2619 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been trying to come up with a reason that I wouldn't give this place 5 stars, and I got nothin'.

But do not discount this store because of it's size it has many of the items you know and love. \\n\\nAnother thing call me crazy but I kinda feel like some of the prices at this store were a little cheaper.

First, their happy hour is very popular and the place is packed during that period. I made a reservation for 6:30 to avoid the big crowd but they were still packed. Good for Moshi. I'm sincerely  glad they're so busy. However, it was very loud and it took them a while to recover after the happy hour crowd left. \\n\\nWhen I called for a reservation I asked if they had gluten free options. The person assured me that they do and stated that they even offer GF soy sauce. We ordered the sashimi combo dinner along with the Pad Thai soup and I again asked if everything that we ordered is gluten free. Our waitress told us that the sushi rice is not because of the type of vinegar that they use. Glad I asked. This could have caused some real problems for my GF dinner partner. She didn't offer any options  but I asked someone else if they had steamed (not sushi) rice they said it was available, so we ordered that. The Pad Thai soup is gluten free and includes rice noodles. \\n\\nThe 2 other diners with us had the Blackened Miso Cod and the Moshi Combo, which included both sushi and sashimi. \\n\\nService in general was very slow and they seemed to be understaffed for the volume of customers that were seated. Our server said that we would have to wait about 30 minutes for our sashimi and sushi because they were backed up. We weren't  in a hurry and enjoyed the Pad Thai soup while waiting. We had to flag our waitress down to get refills on drinks. I wanted a second plate for sharing and finally walked up to the sushi bar and asked for one. \\n\\nThe food was all very good. The establishment is very clean. The staff was friendly but the service was poor because they seemed to be understaffed. The  wait for sushi and sashimi was long. I thought it was a bit pricey. Only 1 person ordered  an alcoholic drink, so I cant blame the bar tab.  I've been to lots of sushi restaurants throughout the US and know what range of pricing to expect.

It was one of the most annoying restaurant experience I've had."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm a Southerner by birth and I spent several years living in Tennessee so I know a thing or two about fried chicken and Nashville hot chicken.  I'm slowly working my way around the Columbus area food scene and fried chicken is definitely not something that has come up on my radar so far.  I've been to the North Market on multiple occasions but only recently have I had a chance to try Hot Chicken Takeover.  Between remodeling, being closed and lines out the door and down the stairs, I kept missing my opportunity to try the food.  This changed a few weeks ago and we've had a chance to try it a few times now.\\n\\nIMO, the food is good - not great, but good.  I've tried the chicken 'cold' (which is basically fried chicken) and 'warm' (which definitely had some spice to it).\\n\\nThe chicken is definitely the best thing on the menu, which is a good thing since it's in the name of the restaurant.  It's well-prepared, fresh and crunchy and isn't overly greasy - which can be a problem with fried chicken and hot chicken in particular.  I'm not a fan of super-spicy food so I found even the mild to be a bit on the hot side for me, but I enjoyed it.  Thankfully, I ordered a sandwich so the bread and slaw helped to cool down some of the heat.  If I were just reviewing the chicken, I would give them a higher score because it is very well done.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, there's more to the meals than chicken.  A lot of this is going to boil down to personal tastes and preferences, but since it's my review, it's my tastes that matter.  The slaw is a vinegar-based slaw.  I'm not a huge fan of vinegar slaw.  I understand why restaurants prepare it - it's cheap and easy to make in mass quantities.  That being said, it's basically cabbage dressed in cider vinegar and in the case of HCT, a creamier slaw would definitely be a better side, as it would have a cooling effect that would contrast nicely with the heat of the chicken.  It's obviously fresh and has a nice crunch, but flavor-wise it's boring and lackluster.\\n\\nLikewise, I'm not a big fan of their mac'n'cheese.  I would describe it as pedestrian.  It's cheesy but has a strange aftertaste to me and it's a bit sticky and gummy.  My wife liked it better than I did, but when I compare it to my mac'n'cheese (a recipe which I shamelessly stole from my favorite BBQ restaurant down South), it doesn't fare so well.  I'm also befuddled by the need to have a double portion with the sandwich (which already comes with four slices of white bread, slaw and pickles).  I'm a hearty eater but it's way too much food and doesn't reheat well.\\n\\nAs a side note to the sides, the pickles are really good and I'm guessing (hoping?) they are made in house.  I'm not sure why I have it in my mind they're homemade (maybe I read it or someone told me that?) but they are very good and compliment everything nicely.\\n\\nThe tea is bone jarringly sweet and is everything a good Southern sweet tea should be.  I grew up in a household where my Mom added a cup of sugar for every quart of tea and pouring it was more like pouring syrup than a drink.  HCT appears to use honey to sweeten their tea and it is very good, although I tend to water mine down a bit to cut the sugar.\\n\\nI should also comment on the service, which is stellar.  I've eaten at HCT several times and the staff are always friendly, energetic and helpful.  Much has been written about the staff and the philosophy of the restaurant so I won't get into that other than to say, the staff are great.  The place is clean and neat and the food has always been consistent.  Don't fear the outrageously long-line - it moves very quickly.\\n\\nLast but not least, price.  Personally, I find the prices to be on the high side.  I just moved back down to the lower 48 after spending 6 years in Alaska, where everything is expensive, so I'm used to paying more.  But as an example, HCT is a lunch place, and just the chicken sandwich is $9.50; if you want the meal, the price skyrockets to $13.  Personally, I find that to be a bit much for lunch and for a piece of fried chicken on white bread.  I understand where some of the costs come from, i.e. from scratch, fresh-made, all-natural chicken, etc. but it's still pricey and that's something to be aware of if you want to eat there.  I look at the price as a contribution to the community service they are providing, but if you're looking for a value meal, this probably isn't your spot.  At the moment, they are the only game in town but if that ever changes, they may have to adjust their pricing and menu strategy."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"As we were walking the Freedom Trail, we noticed everyone had boxes of Mike's Pastry and thinking this place MUST be good if everyone has boxes from there.

Architecture and decor are a great classic mix of detailed, tin-roof, old fashioned diner and a bit of a museum to patriotic New England revolutionary history. The waitperson- perhaps the owner- was an attentive enough middle aged guy who brought us what we asked for with a nice enough attitude. Oh, and the plates were real solid, old-timey ceramic. All the negative stuff stated in some other reviews on here- honestly I didn't see ANY of it on my visit."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This doughnut shop is EVERYTHING!!

If it weren't for my family's love of this place, I'd probably never have stepped foot in here a second time.  \\n\\nTCF tries to be all things for all people, and herein lies its main failure.  It is a jack of all foods, master of none.   In no way is it necessary for a menu to be 15+ pages long.   While I appreciate my ability to order a Thai lettuce wrap, a fried macaroni and cheese ball \\"Glamburger\\" (WTF is a GLAMBURGER? WTF are fried mac n' cheese balls?), Baja chicken tacos, BBQ salmon, etc. all from the same place, I am overwhelmed and even turned off by the sheer number of choices.  After all, if the cooks need to maintain that huge of a repertoire, how are they possibly going to do them well?  There is a very good reason why the best of the best restaurants only offer a few items on the menu.  I'm not saying TCF has to be best of the best, but some restraint would be welcome. \\n\\nEven more of a turn-off than the long menu are the full page advertisements on every other page of said menu.  Cheesecake F. presents itself as a classy date gig--but it really isn't that classy to pick out your Chicken Madeira while simultaneously discovering the best place to get hair electrolysis.  Stay classy, TCF.  You really know how to set the dining mood. \\n\\nWhen you first arrive at TCF, you gather like hungry anxious cattle in the waiting area, hoping your table will be called sometime in the next century.  A 25 minute wait is not even the norm for a Friday/Saturday night--most of the time you are looking at waits upwards of 40-45 minutes.   But TCF will not take reservations, either, so really the only time it makes sense to come here is when nobody in your party is actually hungry.  Gee, that makes a whole lot of sense.  \\n\\nI don't have much to say about the food itself except for every meal I've ever ordered here requires a heavy dose of salt and pepper before it actually starts to taste like food.  \\n\\nYou would think the cheesecake factory's one redeeming quality would be its cheesecake.  But alas, even the cheesecake kind of sucks at the Cheesecake Factory.  Again, too many options and they all basically end up tasting the same.  You can almost  taste the conveyor-belt uninspired uniformity of every slice.  I dare say that the frozen cheesecakes in the grocery store satisfy my cheesecake cravings more.  \\n\\nOne star for the whole wheat bread, which is the only thing I've ever actually enjoyed here, and one star for the dish presentation which showed some attention to detail.  That's as generous as i can be.  \\n\\nOne last thought--when I go to restaurants like TCF, which are notorious for having 1200 calorie + entrees, I typically look for something that might count as \\"lighter fare.\\"  TCF has this really embarrassing way of highlighting all the low-cal options on its \\"Skinnylicious\\" menu. OK, just because I'm trying to eat healthier doesn't mean I like to shout over the din that I'd like to order the \\"Skinnylicious grilled salmon.\\"  Between the \\"Glamburgers\\" and the \\"Skinnylicious salads,\\" i'm starting to think that Paris Hilton inspired this menu."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Mike's Pastry was OK.

When I go there without them, I always make a point of calling my brother on his cell phone.  \\"I'm talking to you with my mouth full of a knish\\"  \\"Wanna hear me chew my Reuben?\\"  He usually starts hurling expletives at me over the phone in reaction to my particular brand of totrture.  Hey, what are big brothers for?\\n\\nEverything I've ever eaten at Zaftig's has been delicious.  And when I dine there with Jewish friends, they swoon.  The service is not always the best.  They have a lot of Dawsons working there.  (As in Dawson's Creek.  Dawson is my standard name for all dumbish, skinny males under the age of 25.)  Yes they are often slow to refill water or call me \\"man\\", \\"dude\\" or \\"bro\\" one annoying time too many, but hey, they're Dawsons.\\n\\nI agree with some of the other reviewers, that Boston is sorely lacking in diners, greasy spoons, etc.  I miss the Empire Deli and Ken's-by-George.  Yet Zaftig's is a reasonable remedy.

For starters, I treated myself with a cup of seafood bisque and their goat cheese medallions; perhaps a misguided choice since both were too rich to finish together. The seafood bisque was excellent, creamy and comforting. The goat cheese medallions were equally good; lightly crusted goat cheese that needed fruit or vegetables to taper the edge. I was going to order their pan-seared chicken only to be told that they had run out that evening. I fell back on the herb-crusted trout (a dinner special) and was pleased to get a lightly fried fresh-tasting fish and perfectly grilled asparagus and steamed veggies.

The fiance' was in heaven. He always made comments before about we Americans seem to like such little fillets of fish. He was so happy he got a \\"big piece of real fish\\" this time. I also heard real chips mumbled from him several times. Yes dear.

Plus, I wanted fried rice instead of the steamed rice...yet another dollar. I ended up paying almost 14 - 15 dollars for one bento box....just felt really nickel and dimed. Additionally, I purchased steamed goyza for an appetizer. The dish did not arrive to the table until the end of the meal. I ate two of the five and didn't really like the dish. They were really mushy and felt microwaved. I sent them back and asked that the are taken off the bill. The manger, Harley, came out and basically accused me of eating too many gozya to send back. She asked me if she could pan fry the goyza instead and I agreed but I still felt this was extremely inappropriate. She told me that if i didn't like it I should have only eaten one.

We love the location, the price and the bar.  The food is solid but they can sometimes miss the mark on service, wrong food order or a missed topping.  They are always willing to resolve the issue but they don't always hit it right for example after bringing a turkey sandwich instead of a burger the burger came without the cheese on top and while they finally got it right they didn't do anything to acknowledge the oversight as far as the bill.  While they don't need to comp the meal a free drink would be a nice offer to make up for the wait.  Like I said I go there often and this is just one experience.  If you find something you love like the sweet potato fries or for me the mandarin chicken salad it is always the same when you order and you an count on it being great.  I hate a place that one day gets something right and the next it is a different item although you haven't changed your order.\\n\\nThey always have specials which I highly recommend, if they offer a fish dish it is always fresh and delicious.  The soups are good and made fresh so if something catches your eye order the soup of the day.  Salads in the summer can be delightful surprises filled with the freshest veggies, I am still thinking about one I had this summer with fresh beets which was awesome.  \\n\\nAlso they servers are relatively attentive and the kitchen is always up for a change to the menu order to meet your tastes for example with a salad you can ask for grilled chicken or salmon to mix things up.  If a salad comes with chicken you can ask for salmon instead and they will be happy to charge a little extra but accommodate the requests.\\n\\nThe drinks are tasty and some make for a dessert alternative.  The almond joy, Kate's crush and chocolate kiss are all delish.  They also offer drink specials, I had a delightful berry rum cooler with lemonade last week which was great.\\n\\nI am a fan and I recommend it for a great pub experience, the music is a little cheesy and a little loud but most of the time you can sit and chat.  If you are just going for a drink they have a great wooden bar that is a great place to pull up to.
